<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c007'>T<i>hose
who are acquainted with Mr.</i>
Ashmole’<i>s</i> History of the most
Noble Order of the Garter, <i>will easily
satisfy themselves; that no Pains or Industry
was wanting to Perfect and Complete so Voluminous
a Work: He had the Encouragement
of a very gracious Prince, and the use
of publick Records, more particularly the several
Books of the</i> Order, <i>with the Assistance
of several MSS wrote by the Officers
of Arms, who bore Part in the Ceremonies,
or went on Embassies to Stranger
Kings, Princes</i>, &amp;c. <i>and by their constant
Observations, were familiarly versed in all
its Laws and Customs</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>These were very great helps to him, and
it must be confessed his own elaborate Study
had not less owing to it. There is nothing
that has relation to this most</i> Noble Order,
<i>which he has not touched on; and indeed
it is a Work so very copious, that he
does himself acknowledge he has inserted some
things of little importance; which he desires
may be considered to be done, to gratify some
few who have a more immediate concern therein</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>The Reader will in this Treatise find little
else omitted: A very painful and exact Abridgment
has been made, many Corrections
of the Author’s, which he saw before his Death,
and left among his other Books in his Library

some Additions are made, a List
continued, of the several</i> Knights-Companions,
<i>as well as Officers of the</i> Order,
<i>for above forty Years; and the Coats of Arms
of abundance of the</i> Knights-Companions
<i>visibly corrected from good Authorities; and
every distinct Chapter treated of at large; so
that this Work has not been compleated but
at great Labour as well as Expence, which
could not have been supported, but for
the Encouragement some of the</i> Knights-Companions
<i>of the</i> most Noble Order

Subscriptions, as in the good Opinion they
seemed to Express of the Design</i>.</p>

IT was, undoubtedly, a good Sentiment in
the first Collector of this Learned Work,
to introduce, as well as a Discourse of
<i>Knighthood</i> in general, a Treatise of all
the several <i>Orders</i> that have prevail’d in
other Parts of the World; for these in
their Rise and Institutions, having a relative Sense to
the particular Subject he was to illustrate, seemed to
afford him a very good Opportunity of doing it, by
building on so convenient a Foundation.</p>

<p class='c000'>I shall therefore, (tho’ much more confin’d to brevity)
follow the same Method, making it serve as a
proper Introduction; there being many Things in the
voluminous Original, which I conceive may with less
Inconveniency be dispenc’d with.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>It</span> was a constant Maxim in all well-regulated Governments,
to give a just Encouragement to Merit, and
this by proportioning Rewards to the Service done;
for Merit must be suppos’d to consist in the Performance
<span class='pageno' title='2' id='Page_2'></span>of some Virtuous or Heroick Action, directed
for the publick Good: And as Vertue is either Military
or Civil, so the Distribution of Rewards is different;
either by bestowing Degrees and Titles of Honour,
or by Donations of Wealth; so that in either
Construction, Vertue may have its proper and suitable
Reward.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>But</span> the proper Reward of Military <i>Vertue</i>, is Honour:
(to which distinct Head this Work is confin’d.)
Honour, which <i>Aristotle</i> calls the <i>Greatest of exteriour
Goods</i>: And being an Object of a nobler Ambition
than the Accumulation of Wealth, is principally the
Aim of that <i>Vertue</i> we understand by <i>Valour</i>; which
springs from more generous Spirits, and hath been the
constant Foundation of raising Men to the highest
Eminence of Glory, and superiour Dignity.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>But</span> that Fame might not lose itself in an unbounded
Notion, it was at length thought fit to reduce Honour
into Form and Order, by investing the Person meriting
with some particular Title or Appellation of Excellence,
(the Original of all Nobility;) of which Knighthood,
as it hath been accounted the most suitable Reward
to the greatest Vertue, so it hath been esteemed the
chief and primary Honour among many Nations.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> <i>Romans</i> held Honour and Vertue in that Esteem,
that they deify’d, and dedicated Temples to them:
They made them so contiguous in their Situation, that
there was no other Passage to that of Honour, but thro’
the Temple of Vertue, mystically admonishing, that
Honour was not to be attained by any other Way.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> several of the <i>Roman</i> Coins we see Honour and
Vertue represented together in one Reverse, and in one
Medal; the Face of Honour so shadows that of Vertue,
that but a little of it appears, <i>Honour being the more illustrious
of the two; and where we behold any Person outwardly
adorned with it, we are to judge him inwardly endued with
Vertue, inasmuch as Honour is his due, and justly bestowed
upon him</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>§. 2. <span class='sc'>In</span> tracing the Original of Knighthood, we are
not so vain to say, with the <i>French</i>, that S. <i>Michael</i> was
the <i>premier Chevalier</i>; yet thus much we may assert, that
’tis near as ancient as Valour and Heroic Vertue, notwithstanding
the Ceremonies and Circumstances of it
have varied according to several Ages and Nations: And
therefore, with much Probability, we may derive the
<span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span>Original of Military Honour from the <i>Trojans</i> and
<i>Greeks</i>; among whom, as Knights of great Renown,
were <i>Hector</i>, <i>Troilus</i>, <i>Æneas</i>, <i>Antenor</i>, <i>Agamemnon</i>, <i>Menelaus</i>,
<i>Peleus</i>, <i>Tydeus</i>, &amp;c. And thus <i>Homer</i> uses the
Word ἱππότης, in the same Sense as <i>Eques</i> was afterwards
among the <i>Latins</i>.</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>’Mong whom thus <i>Nestor</i> spake, that honour’d Knight.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>§. 3. <span class='sc'>Upon</span> a more substantial Basis we shall descend
to the <i>Romans</i>; among whom, in the very Infancy of
their Military Glory, a Society of Knights was instituted,
immediately after their Union with the <i>Sabines</i>. <i>Romulus</i>
inrolled <i>Centuriæ tres Equitum</i>, three Centuries of
Knights, out of the chiefest Families, whom he appointed
to be his Life-guard, and called them <i>Celeres</i>,
from their Activity and Dispatch in Martial Affairs.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Tarquinius Priscus</i> made an Addition to these Centuries;
the like did <i>Servius Tullius</i>, who ordained, that
those who should succeed in that Body, should be
elected <i>ex censu</i>, <i>viz.</i> from a considerable and certain
Valuation of their Estates, who had the greatest Cense,
and were of the most Noble Families, says <i>Dyonys. Halicarn.</i>
And soon after, the Equestrian Class began to be
formed and constituted one of the three Orders of the
Commonwealth, which were thus rank’d, according to
<i>Livy</i>: <i>Senatus, Ordo Equestris &amp; Plebs</i>; which in the <i>Roman</i>
Literal Notes is set down after this Manner:
CON. SEN. E. ORD. P. Q. R. And forasmuch as
this Degree is placed between the <i>Patricians</i>, or Senators,
and the <i>Plebeians</i>, it answers exactly the State of our
Knights between the Nobility and Commonalty: And
from this Order, to the Height of Nobility which resided
in the Senators, was the Way prepared; <i>Junius Brutus</i>
being the first who was raised to a Senator from the
Equestrian Order.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>It</span> was a Constitution, as old as <i>Tiberius</i>’s Reign, that
none should be admitted, unless Free-born, or a Gentleman
for three Generations; and, indeed, for a long
Time none were elected Knights but the best Sort of
Gentlemen, and Persons of Extraction, as was the illustrious
<i>Mœcenas</i>.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>who aspired no higher, not out of any Incapacity of
attaining greater Honours, but that he desired them not,
says <i>Paterculus</i>: Yet at length, thro’ Corruption of
Times, Plebeians and Freedmen being too frequently received
into this Degree (too near a Parallel among the
Knights of this Age) occasion’d their Power to grow
less and less, ’till it shrunk to nothing; so that the Places
and Offices of Judges which they before had executed,
became conferrable upon the <i>Publicans</i>. And when
<i>Cicero</i> was Consul, <i>anno ab urbe conditi</i> 690, the Equestrian
Order stood in need of Re-establishment, whereupon
they were then incorporated into that Commonwealth
in the third Degree, all Acts passing <i>in the Name of the
Senate, the People of</i> Rome, <i>and the Equestrian Order</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>They often enjoy’d Abroad the Government of several
Provinces, whereof <i>Egypt</i> had this peculiar to itself,
that none of the Senators were admitted, but only those
of the Equestrian Order, whose Decrees <i>Augustus</i> commanded
to be had in like Regard, as if the Magistrates
of <i>Rome</i>, or Kings, Consuls, or Prætors, had pronounced
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a Mark of Eminence, they had the Titles of
<i>Splendidi</i> and <i>Illustres</i> bestowed upon them, and sometimes
have been called <i>most sacred</i> Knights.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>And</span> besides other Privileges, they had Seats with the
Senators in the <i>Circus Maximus</i>; and by the <i>Roscian</i> Law,
sat next them in the Theatres: They had likewise a
College called <i>Collegium Equitum</i>; and Temples were
dedicated to the Goddess <i>Fortune</i>, under the Title of
<i>Equestri Fortunæ</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Having</span> shewn the Dignity and Honours of the Equestrian
Order among the <i>Romans</i>, we shall now touch
upon the Degrees of Knighthood which have been
Personal, and may be comprehended under the Modern
Title of <i>Equites Aurati</i>, or <i>Milites Simplices</i>, (as distinguish’d
from the several Orders of Chivalry, instituted
in Christendom.) In the Circumstance of whose Creation
we confess, nothing in the <i>Roman Ordo Equestris</i>
hath place, tho’ that might be the Ground and Original
of the Dignity, and one common End in both, namely,
the Pursuit of Military Exploits, and Service in the
Wars.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>§. 4. <span class='sc'>Of</span> the Degrees of Knighthood. We shall first
of the <i>Monozons</i>, i. e. Knights begirt with the Military
Girdle, a Custom devolved to the <i>Germans</i> and <i>Gauls</i>
from ancient Times, and from them to After-Ages.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Sir</span> <i>Henry Spelman</i> notes, <i>That the late Emperors conferred
the Dignity of Knighthood with the Military Girdle instead of
all other Arms, because that Part more eminent amongst them
girdeth, supporteth, and adorneth the rest</i>; whence <i>Selden</i>
calls this Girding the most essential part of the Ceremony.
Nor do we find among the various Ceremonies
of <i>Knighthood</i> any that have continued so constant in
Practice as the endowing with Girdle and Sword, Ornaments
proper to the Dignity and Marks of <i>Honour</i> and
<i>Vertue</i>, with which the Statues and Portraitures of
<i>Knights</i>, on their Grave-stones have been adorned.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>For</span> as at this Day <i>Knights</i> are styled <i>Equites Aurati</i>,
from the Golden Spurs, heretofore put on at their
Creation, so were they more anciently <i>Singulo Miletari
donati</i>, in respect, when any one was <i>Knighted</i>, he was
not only smitten with the Sword, but invested with
Sword and Belt, yet retain’d at the creating our Knights
of the <i>Bath</i>, as the old Formulary thus hath it;
<span class='goth'>
Then shall the King of great Favour take the
Sword, and gird the Esquire therewith.
</span></p>

<p class='c000'>Secondly, The <i>Baccalaurei</i> or Knights Batchelors, are
to be consider’d, who are indifferently styled <i>Chevaliers</i>,
<i>Milites</i>, <i>Equites Aurati</i>, and <i>Knights</i>. This Degree is truly
accounted the first of all Military Dignity, and the
Foundation of all Honours in our Nation, and is derived
from, if not the same with that immediately preceding.
For as the Ceremony of a gentle Touch on
the Shoulder with the flat Side of the Sword hath been
since used, instead of girting with the Sword and Belt,
(especially in Times of War, or in Haste) as an Initiation
into the Military Order; so on the contrary, it is
not unusual now-adays, for the Prince, at least <i>Gladio</i>,
if not <i>Cingulo donare</i>; for he oftentimes bestows the
Sword upon the Person he <i>Knighteth</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Miræus</i> gives them the Epithet <i>Aurati</i>, from the Privilege
of wearing Gold upon their Swords and Spurs,
omitting <i>Tiraquel</i>’s fanciful Distinction between <i>Miles</i> and
<i>Eques Auratus</i>, who allows the former to signify a Knight
Noble before, and the other to denote one whom we
call a Knight and no Gentleman, or applicable to the
<i>Neapolitan</i> Gentlemen, (usually called <i>Cavalieri</i>) who
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>are all styled <i>Equites</i>, tho’ they never have attained the
Knightly Dignity.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> third Sort were <i>Knights Banerets</i>, who so well deserv’d
in the Wars, that they were afterwards permitted
to use <i>Vexillum quadratum</i>, a square Banner, whence they
were called <i>Equites vexillarii</i>, or <i>Chevaliers a Buniere</i> from
the Dutch <i>Banerheere</i>, Lord or Master of the Banner.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Camden</i> conceives this Title first devis’d by K. <i>Edward</i> 3.
in Recompence of Martial Prowess; a Recital of which
Dignity is mention’d in a <a id='patent' name='patent'></a>Patent 20 <i>E.</i> 3. to <i>John Coupland</i>,
for his Service, in taking <i>David</i> King of <i>Scots</i> Prisoner.
But it was much more ancient with us, as well
as in <i>France</i>; and they had particular Robes, and other
Ornaments given them from the Crown, <i>ad apparatum
suum pro militia, tanquam pro Baneretto, a Rege suscipienda</i>,
&amp;c. <i>viz.</i> <i>ad unum Tunicam</i>, &amp;c. after which is set down
the particular Robes, and other Ornaments appointed
for his Creation.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>To</span> shew this Dignity yet more ancient, there is the
Evidence of a Writ in K. <i>Edw.</i> 3d’s Time, for furnishing
<i>Thomas Bardolf</i> with the Robes of a <i>Baneret</i>. It is an Honour
esteemed the last among the Greatest, <i>viz.</i> <i>Nobilitum
Majorum</i>, or the First of the Second Rank; and is placed
in the Middle between the <i>Barons</i> and the other <i>Knights</i>;
in which respect the <i>Baneret</i> may be called <i>Vexillarius
minor</i>, as if he were the lesser <i>Banner-Bearer</i>; to the End
he might be so differenced from the Greater, namely
the <i>Baron</i>, to whom the Right of bearing a square
Banner doth belong.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>But</span> there are some remarkable differences between
these Knights and Knights-Batchelors; as in the Occasions
and Circumstances of their Creations, the <i>Baneret</i>
being not Created, unless at a Time when the King’s
Standard is erected, and that he bears his own Banner
in the Field; whilst the <i>Knight-Batchelor</i> follows that
which is anothers.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>This</span> farther difference is observed between them,
that the <i>Knight-Baneret</i> had so many Gentlemen his Servants
at Command, as that he could raise a Banner, and
make up a Company of Soldiers to be maintained at his
Table, and with his own Pay: But the <i>Knight-Batchelor</i>
had not sufficient for this, and therefore marched under
the Banner of another; and the Wages of the <i>Baneret</i>
were double.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span><span class='sc'>Next</span> to these, we are to mention Knights of the
<i>Bath</i>, which is a Degree that hath the Investiture and
Title of Knight, with an additional Denomination,
derived from Part of the Ceremony of his Creation.
It is the general receiv’d Opinion, that our K. <i>Hen.</i> 4.
first instituted these Knights, which is justify’d by Sir
<i>John Froisard</i>, who says he created 46 of them at his
Coronation, chusing them from such, as were either
his Favorites, or had pretensions to it from their personal
Merits, or Services.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>But</span> if the Ceremonies and Circumstances of their
Creation be well consider’d, it may be inferr’d, that he
rather restor’d the ancient way of making Knights, than
Instituted them; and consequently that the Knights
of the <i>Bath</i>, are really no other than <i>Knights-Batchelors</i>;
that is, such as are created with those Ceremonies,
wherewith <i>Knights-Batchelors</i> were formerly created by
Ecclesiasticks: But some of them having been laid aside,
were then brought again into Use, and made peculiar
to this Degree, and since continued to them upon some
solemn and great Occasion.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>At</span> the first View they look like a distinct Order of
Knighthood; but cannot be so accounted, because they
have no Statutes assigned them, nor are in Case of Vacancy,
supply’d, (the Essentials of distinct Orders) nor
do they wear their Robes beyond the Time of that Occasion
upon which they were created; as chiefly, the
Coronation of a King or Queen, the Creation of a Prince
of <i>Wales</i>, Duke of <i>York</i>, and the like; whereas also
their Number is uncertain, and always at the Pleasure
of the King.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Favine</i> calls them Knights of the Crown, because, to
distinguish them from Esquires, they wore upon their
Left Shoulder an Escutcheon of Black Silk embroider’d
with three Crowns of Gold; but therein he mistakes,
for they never used only a Silk Lace, and the Jewel they
wore was made of Gold, containing three Crowns, with
this Motto <i>Tria juncta in una</i>, hanging down under the
left Arm at a Carnation Ribbon worn cross the Body.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>This</span> leads us to the Degree of Baronets, who seem
allied to Knighthood, by having granted them the Addition
of <i>Sir</i> to be set before their Names: But this
gives them not the Dignity of Knighthood; nor can
they properly be styled Knights, until they be actually
Knighted.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span><span class='sc'>It</span> is a Degree erected <i>Anno</i> 9. <i>Jac.</i> 1. and the Grant
made by Letters Patents under the Great Seal of <i>England</i>.
It is Hereditary to them, and the Heirs Male of
their Bodies lawfully begotten, for ever; and by a
subsequent Decree of the said King, Precedence is
granted to them before all Banerets, except such as
should be made by the King under his Standard, display’d
in an Army Royal in open War, and the King
personally present, and next to and immediately after
the younger Sons of Viscount and Barons.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Ground for erecting this Degree was partly
Martial; for tho’ themselves were not enjoined personal
Service in the Wars, yet each Baronet was to maintain
thirty Foot Soldiers for three Years in <i>Ireland</i>, after the
rate of Eight Pence <i>per</i> Day, for the Defence of that
Kingdom, and chiefly to secure the Plantation of <i>Ulster</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>They</span> were at least to be descended from a Grand-father,
on the Father’s Side, that bore Arms, and had
a Revenue of 1000 <i>l. per Ann.</i> or Lands of old Rents
of equal Value with 1000 <i>l. per Ann.</i> of improv’d Lands,
or at least two Parts of three of such Estate in Possession;
the other third in Reversion Expectant upon one Life
held only in Jointure.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Year after, King <i>James</i> I. added some new Privileges
and Ornaments, <i>viz.</i> to Knight those already
made that were no Knights; and the Heirs hereafter of
every Baronet should, at the Age of One and Twenty
Years, receive Knighthood; likewise that all Baronets
might bear in Canton, or in an Inescutcheon, the Arms
of <i>Ulster</i>; and farther, to have place in the Armies of
the King in the Gross, near about the Royal Standard.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Since</span> the Institution of Baronets in <i>England</i>, there
have been made divers in <i>Ireland</i> after the like Form:
And the Knights of <i>Nova Scotia</i> in the <i>West-Indies</i> were
ordained in Imitation of Baronets in <i>England</i> by the said
King <i>James</i>, <i>A. D.</i> 1622. for the Planting that Country
by <i>Scotch</i> Colonies, and the Degree made likewise
Hereditary.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>These</span> latter wear an Orange Tawny Ribbon as their
Badge, to distinguish them from other Knights; and it
appears, there was an Intention, 1627. to move his
then Majesty, that all Baronets and Knights Bachelors
might wear Ribbons of several Colours, some Badge
or Jewel, in such Sort as did the Knights of the <i>Bath</i>,
to distinguish the one from the other: But that Matter
dropt.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>§. 5. <span class='sc'>We</span> shall now observe the Etymology of <i>Eques</i>,
<i>Miles</i>, <i>Chevalier</i>, <i>Ritter</i>, and <i>Sir</i>. The <i>Grecians</i> had a Title
of Honour equivalent to the Signification of <i>Eques</i> in
the <i>Latin</i>, from <i>Equus</i>, an Horse, because one Part of
the Ceremony, whereby this Honour became conferred,
was the giving of an Horse; or because having
an Horse at the Publick Charge, they received the
Stipend of an Horseman to serve in the Wars, Horses
being Symbols of War, <i>Bello armantur equi</i>. It is to
be noted, That the Degree of Knighthood in the Dialects
of other Nations hath the same Derivation: For
in the <i>French</i>, a Knight is called <i>Chevalier</i>; in the <i>German</i>,
<i>Ridder</i>, or <i>Ritter</i>, <i>q. d.</i> <i>Rider</i>; so the <i>Gheslagen
Ridder</i> is interpreted, <i>The dubbed Knight</i>; in the <i>Italian</i>,
it is <i>Cavagliero</i>; in the old <i>British</i>, <i>Morchog</i>; concerning
which, hear one of <i>Jeffery Chaucer</i>’s Scholars.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>And</span> tho’ the Word <i>Miles</i> signified at first any legally
inrolled for the War, which Inrolment was twofold,
<i>Honoraria</i> and <i>Vulgaris</i>; yet upon the Decay of the <i>Roman</i>
Empire, upon the Irruption of the innumerable
Forces of the <i>Alani, Goths, Vandals, &amp;c.</i> which consisted
in Horse, their Foot was rendred useless. <i>Miles</i> was no
longer said of him that served on Foot in the Wars, but
began to be properly spoken of the Horseman; whence
it came into Vogue, That among the Titles of Nobility,
he who had that of <i>Miles</i> bestowed on him, was understood
to be Horseman, or <i>Eques</i>, that is, of the Equestrian
Dignity.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Selden</i> observes <i>Miles</i> to be equivocal: and that in the
old feodal Laws of the Empire it signify’d a Gentleman,
as the Word Gentleman is signify’d in <i>Nobilis</i>; and with
us it hath been frequently used to denote both Gentlemen,
and Knights; for <i>Milites</i> denotes Gentlemen,
or great Freeholders, and not dubbed Knights, <i>viz.</i>
such who hold by Knights Service from a Lord of
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>a Mannour, and such who are chosen from the several
Counties to serve in the High Courts of Parliament.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Miles</i>, even in the <i>Saxon</i> Times, denoted sometimes a
Dignity. But about the Year 1046, becoming a Title
of Honour, it is since most generally appropriated to
Persons who have received Knighthood correspondent
to <i>Eques</i> and <i>Chevalier</i>, tho’ indeed less proper; in regard
Knighthood is the Dignity of Horsemanship, and the
Tenure of Lands by Knights Fees here in <i>England</i>,
anciently called <i>Regale Servitium</i>, is in truth Horse Service;
and the Tenants such as served the King on
Horseback in Wars, are Gentlemen at least (if not of
Noble Extraction.)</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Minshew</i> says, the <i>Equites</i>, which heretofore followed
and accompanied the Emperor, are, in the <i>German</i>
Tongue, called <i>Knechtes</i>, that is, Servitors, or Ministers;
but <i>Camden</i> says, <i>Knecht</i>, in <i>Saxon</i> <i>Cniht</i>, was in far more
ancient Times accepted as an honorary Title; and,
among the old <i>Germans</i>, signify’d a Person arm’d with
Spear and Lance, (the Ensigns of their Knighthood)
as in After-Times such were, among other Nations,
adorned with a Girdle and Belt, since called <i>Equites
aurati</i>, and sometimes simply <i>Milites</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Addition <i>Sir</i> to the Names of all Knights Banerets,
Knights of the <i>Bath</i>, and Batchelor Knights, pronounced
at the Time when they are created, with this
Compellation: <i>Arise, Sir John</i>, or <i>Sir Thomas, &amp;c.</i> is
accounted Parcel of their Style, which the Banerets enjoy
by virtue of a Clause in their Patent. It is a Contraction
of the Old <i>French</i> Sire, taken for Seigneur, or
Lord, from the <i>Greek</i> Κύριος. But how it came to be
first given, we cannot find; nevertheless, our <i>English</i>
Writers have bestowed it upon the major Part of the
Nobility, after they had been received into the Order
of Knighthood; and in the Life of St. <i>Thomas Becket</i>,
written about the Time of King <i>Edw.</i> 1. we meet with
the Title prefix’d to the Names of the four Knights,
who slew the said St. <i>Thomas</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>§. 6. <span class='sc'>The</span> Ensigns of the Equestrian Order among
the <i>Romans</i>, by which they were made, was a Publick
Horse, or a Gold Ring; yet still, to those who had
Equestrian Cense, the Horse was the ancienter Badge
of the two; but when thro’ the Multitude of these
Knights no Publick Horses were assigned, but to such
who were ready to enter upon Military Service, and to
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>fight in the Legions, such were called <i>Legionary Knights</i>,
to distinguish them from the rest, who had only receiv’d
the Honour of a Gold-Ring; for they were not all
employ’d in Wars.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Censor (after the Institution of that Office <i>ab
urbe condita</i>, 310.) and afterwards the Emperor, were
the Persons who bestowed this <i>Equus Militaris</i>, or <i>Publicus</i>,
as it was called from the Annual Allowance, to
keep him, which they gave unto those of known Vertue
and approv’d Life, compelling him to serve in the
Wars, tho’ against his Will; (but in the more ancient
Method of Election, Constraint was not used.) And
upon Negligence in the Care of these Horses, or any
Blemish, Reproach, or Infamy, or Loss of Patrimony
in the Knights, the Horses were not only taken away,
but the Knights wholly disfranchis’d. <i>Rosinus</i> laying
down the Manner and Order used in ejecting such
Knights, adds, <i>A Recital being made of all the Knights that
were inrolled, those whose Names he omitted, were thereby understood
to be depriv’d of that Dignity</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>When</span> they had served in the Wars the Time appointed
by Law, it was the Custom to lead their Horses by
the Bridle into the Forum, before the <i>Duumvirs</i> [Censors,]
and giving an Account under whom and what
Generals or Captains they had served; they were
thereupon dismissed from farther Service in the Wars:
An Example whereof <i>Plutarch</i> relates to have been given
by <i>Pompey</i> himself.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>But</span> whereas among the <i>Roman</i> Inscriptions we find
<i>Equo publico honoratus donatus</i>, <i>ornatus</i>, and <i>exornatus</i>, such
is not to be construed to be of Equestrian Dignity, but
only to have received the <i>præmia militaria</i>, with which
the Emperors used to recompense some particular Exploit,
by the Honour of such a Gift, according to <i>Salmasius</i>.
<i>Equus Publicus</i>, by a wondrous, nevertheless
an accustom’d Speech, among the <i>Romans</i>, is the Knight,
<i>qui equo publico meret</i>. And <i>qui equo publico donatus</i>, the
other deserving Person.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>As</span> to the Ring: In <i>Genesis</i> we read of <i>Pharoah</i>’s taking
off his Ring, and putting it upon <i>Joseph</i>’s Hand. When
they came in Fashion with the <i>Romans</i>, the Senators at
first wore Iron ones, which were accounted the Ensign
of Military Vertue, received upon a Publick Account.
Howbeit, in Process of Time, when Gold Rings were
drawn into Use, none but Senators and Knights had
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>them. The Difference among the Rings of the three
Orders in the State were, as <i>Licetus</i> observes, Gold Rings
set with precious Stones were given to the Senators only;
Plain Rings without Stones to the Knights, and
Iron Rings to the <i>Plebeians</i>, or Free-born-men; insomuch
that <i>Equestri dignitate donare</i> and <i>annulo honorare</i>,
is a promiscuous Phrase in <i>Tacitus</i>, to give the Dignity
of Knighthood; and at the Battle of <i>Cannæ</i>, by the two
Measures or Bushels of Gold Rings sent to <i>Carthage</i>, the
Number of the <i>Roman</i> Knights there slain was computed.</p>

<p class='c000'>§. 7. <span class='sc'>At</span> length Freed-Men being created Knights,
the <i>Jus annulorum</i>, the Right of wearing Gold Rings,
became promiscuous.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Among</span> the <i>Germans</i>, the Shield and Lance were accounted
the grand Badges of Military Honour, or
Knighthood. This the <i>Lombards</i>, the <i>Franks</i>, and our
Country-men, all descending out of <i>Germany</i>, used, and
was to us (in the Opinion of Sir <i>Hen. Spelman</i>) the
Foundation of the Knightly Order. Much like the
ancient <i>Germans</i> was the Custom of making Knights
among the <i>Irish</i>: And <i>Favine</i> notes the Shield and Lance
were the proper Arms appertaining to a <i>French</i> Knight,
which Esquires, <i>Armigers</i>, carried always after their
Masters, Shields and Scutes (as they are vulgarly called)
<i>i. e.</i> Equestrian Targets, inclining to an Oval, not
Shields or Bucklers of Foot Soldiers.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Another</span> Ensign and Ornament of Knightly Honour
is, the <i>Cingulum militare</i>, or <i>Balteus</i>, which, <i>Varro</i> says,
is <i>Tuscan</i>, signifying a military Girdle, which were
garnished with great Buckles, Studs, and Rings of pure
Gold, to shew their Dignity and Power in military Commands;
and with such a Belt, set with Pearls and
precious Stones, young <i>Athelstan</i> was girded, when he
receiv’d <i>Knighthood</i> from his Grandfather King <i>Alfred</i>.
Our Knights were no less anciently known by these
Belts, than by their gilt Swords, Spurs, <i>&amp;c.</i> Howbeit
the Use now only appears in Knights of the <i>Bath</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>To</span> this Belt was also added a Sword, not of Ordinary
Use; and therefore termed the Sword of a <i>Knight</i>,
which was hallowed with great Ceremony.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Another</span> eminent Badge is the Golden Spurs, wherewith,
at the Time of their Creation, Knights Spurs
were wont to be adorned; and to these, a little after the
Conquest, were added far more and greater Ornaments.
They were usually put on after the Person had been
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>presented to the Prince who gave the Honour, to signify,
that the new-made Knight should not only declare his
Valour by his Sword, but also by the Management of
his Horse, which he should encourage and excite with
his Spurs, to the carrying on his valiant Designs. These
Spurs have been of that Esteem, that Knight Batchelors
are latinized <i>Equites aurati</i>; among the <i>Germans</i>, <i>Ritter
dess Gulden Sporns</i>; and with us heretofore, <i>Knights of the
Spurs</i>: And several Families by the Name of <i>Knight</i>,
bear for their Arms the Spurs on a Canton.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>It</span> is farther certify’d among the Rights of a Knight
Baneret, that upon the Account of his Knighthood he
may wear gilt Spurs, as well as a gilt Sword; and that
the Spurs are essential, may be collected from the Degradation
of a Knight, where his gilt Spurs are first cut
off with an Hatchet, the Case of Sir <i>Andra Harcla</i>. In
the last Place is the Collar, an Ensign of Knightly Dignity
among the <i>Germans</i>, <i>Gauls</i>, <i>Britons</i>, <i>Danes</i> and <i>Goths</i>,
among whom it was customary to wear them, as denoting
such as were remarkable for their Valour. But in
later Times, it was the peculiar Fashion of <i>Knights</i>
among us to wear Golden Collars composed of <i>S S.</i>
or other various Devices; so that those <i>Monuments</i> are
known to be erected for <i>Knights</i> on whose Portraitures
such Ornaments are found.</p>

<p class='c000'>§. 8. <span class='sc'>The</span> Qualifications for Knighthood are principally
three. 1. Merit, the bare mentioning whereof
shall suffice here. 2. Birth, <i>viz.</i> that the Parties who
enter thereinto ought first to make appear they be
Gentlemen of three Paternal Descents, bearing Coat
Armour; and much the same was the Law of the Empire
under <i>Frederick</i> 2. <i>A. D.</i> 1212. Some think it also
insufficient, unless descended so by the Mother’s Side;
at least she must be a freed Woman. And, 3. Estate,
which also serves to support the Dignity.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Thus</span> Wealth was so much regarded among the <i>Chaledonians</i>,
that those who were rich, bore the Name of
Knights. It was Estate that entitled a Man to this
Honour among the <i>Romans</i>; for the Censor might
compel any Citizen equal to the Equestrian Cense,
whom he thought fit to take that Order: And this
consisted of 400000 Sesterces, <i>i. e.</i> 3025 <i>l.</i> of our Money.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>And</span> as in <i>Old Rome</i>, so here in <i>England</i>, not long after
the Conquest, they who held a Knights Fee, <i>viz.</i> 680
Acres of Land might claim it, says <i>Camden</i>. But it appears
from <i>Selden</i>, that no certain Number, or Extent
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>of Acres, made a Knight’s Fee; and <i>Temp. Hen.</i> 3. and
<i>Edw.</i> 1. and 1 <i>Edw.</i> 2. the <i>Census militis</i> was measured
by 20 <i>l.</i> by the Year, or more; and by the Royal Prerogative,
some who held 15, then 20, at other times
30, then 40, and sometimes 50 <i>l.</i> Lands, were required
to accept this Honour by Writs directed to the Sheriffs
of the Counties, and were excused only by Reason of
old Age, irrecoverable Weakness, Loss of Limbs, or
being in Holy Orders; and upon all other Causes (if
exempted) they paid a Fine, estimated according to
the Nature of the Excuse, or length of Time given.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>But</span> in the promiscuous Course of Knighthood, where
the Men of Wealth and Estate (whether otherwise
worthy or not) became dignify’d; yet the Gate of
Honour was not then shut against those, who wanting
Riches, deserved well of their Country; for when
Princes conferr’d such Dignities upon Men of narrow
Fortunes, they usually bestowed with them annual Pensions,
or Lands, agreeable to the Judgment of the Author
of the <i>Division du monde</i>, who saith that the Honour
of Knighthood is not to be given any Person who
hath not a considerable Estate, unless sufficient Means to
support the Honour of the Order be also given with it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>These</span> Pensions are frequently mention’d in our Rolls,
sometimes during Pleasure, and sometimes during the
Life of the Knight, or till better Provision should be
made for their Supports: Examples whereof are, Sir
<i>John Atte Lee</i>, Sir <i>Nele Loring</i>, Sir <i>John Walsh</i>, Knights.
The like Rewards our Kings gave to such whose Merit
raised them to the Degree of a <i>Baneret</i>, express’d in their
Patents, <i>ad manutenendum statum Baneretti</i>, <i>Pro sustentatione
sua</i>, <i>ut ipse statum Baneretti melius manutenere possit</i>, <i>Pro statu
suo manutenendo</i>; or Words to the like Effect: Examples
where of are, Sir <i>Reginald Cobham</i>, Sir <i>Thomas de Rokeley</i>,
Sir <i>John Lysle</i>, and Sir <i>Roger de Swynerton</i>, Banerets.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>It</span> may be next consider’d who can make <i>Knights</i>;
wherein it is apparent, that they who never were, and
others who never could be <i>Knights</i>, have conferr’d this
Dignity; yet ’tis to be understood, that Necessity and
Custom hath in this Case the Force of a Law: For anciently,
<i>Bishops</i> and <i>Priests</i> made <i>Knights</i>; so also do the
<i>Popes</i>, and some Commonwealths; likewise our <i>Queens</i>.
For the <i>Sovereign</i>, or the <i>Heir apparent</i>, tho’ they be no
<i>Knights</i>, may nevertheless do it, by reason they possess
the <i>Kingdom</i>; and are therefore the Head and Chief of
<i>Chevalry</i>, and consequent all the Power thereof is contained
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>in their Command. To conclude this Point,
<i>Knighthood</i> was always received from the Hands of another
Person, either by Ceremony, or Diploma, except only
the Kings of <i>Spain</i>, who Time out of Mind made themselves
<i>Knights</i>; and this by Vertue of an old Law written
in the <i>Arragonian</i> Tongue, as <i>Ambrosias Morales</i> reports.
<i>And, to shew that no Man upon Earth hath any Power over
him, he shall gird himself with the Sword made after the Form
of a Cross; and that Day can no other Man be Knighted.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>§. 9. Of the Ceremonies and Formalities used at the
Conferring of Knighthood, the most ancient was perform’d
by putting the Belt loose over the Shoulder, or
girding it close about the Waste. The <i>Bend</i> in <i>Armoury</i>
represents the one, and the <i>Fess</i> the other. The first
Christian Kings at giving this Belt kissed the new Knight
on the Left Cheek, saying, <i>In the Honour of the Father,
and the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, I make you a Knight</i>.
It was called <i>Osculum pacis</i>, the Kiss of Favour, or Brotherhood,
and is presumed to be the Accollade, or Ceremony
of Imbracing, which <i>Charles</i> the Great used when
he Knighted his Son <i>Lewis</i> the <i>Debonair</i>. It was in the
Time of the same Emperor, the Way of Knighting by the
<i>Colaphum</i>, or Blow on the Ear, used in Sign of sustaining
future Hardships, which is thought to have been deriv’d
from the Manner of Manumission of a Slave among the
<i>Romans</i>; a Custom long after retained in <i>Germany</i> and
<i>France</i>. Thus <i>William</i> Earl of <i>Holland</i>, who was to be
Knighted before he could be <i>Emperor</i>, at his being elected
King of the <i>Romans</i>, received Knighthood by the Box of
the Ear, <i>&amp;c.</i> from <i>John</i> King of <i>Bohemia</i>, <i>A. D.</i> 1247.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> the Time of the <i>Saxons</i> here in <i>England</i>, Knights received
their Institutions at the Hands of Great <i>Prelates</i> or
<i>Abbots</i>; which, according to their Opinion, render’d them
more auspicious. In the accomplishing of which Solemnity,
they added many religious Ceremonies, as Watching,
Fasting, Bathing, and Consecrating the Sword; an
Instance of which we have in <i>Heward</i> Lord of <i>Brune</i>, <a id='brune' name='brune'></a>in
<i>Lincolnshire</i>, who received this Honour from <i>Brand,
Abbot</i> of St. <i>Edmundsbury</i>. But not long after the Conquest,
this Custom was restrained by a Synod <a id='at' name='at'></a>at <i>Westminster</i>,
<i>A. D.</i> 1102. 3 <i>H.</i> 1. which among other Things
ordained <i>Ne Abbates</i> [<i>i. e.</i> all Spiritual Persons] <i>faciunt
milites</i>. However the religious Ceremonies for the most
part continued, especially Vigils and Bathings, as appears
by that grand Solemnity at the Creation of 267
Knights, Sons of Earls, Barons, and Knights, upon
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span><i>Whitsontide</i>, <i>anno</i> 34 <i>Edw.</i> 1. cited by <i>Selden</i> and <i>Camden</i>.
And these Formalities the <i>Saxons</i> and <i>Normans</i>, not only
here in <i>England</i>, but the <i>French</i>, <i>Spaniards</i>, and other
Nations, observ’d, concluding from it, that decency
of Habit was as well expected from them, as Integrity
of Life, and purity of Manners. And the like religious
Ceremony was heretofore observ’d in <i>Spain</i> at the Creation
of Knights, whether <i>Cavelleros de Espuela d’Orada</i>,
or <i>Amados</i> [our Knights Batchelors,] In this Form, the
Person to be Knighted was bathed in the Evening, and
presently laid in Bed; then cloathed in rich Robes, and
led to the Church to perform his Vigils: That being
over, and Mass heard, his Spurs were put on, and his
Sword girt about him, then drawn out, and put into
his Right Hand; whereupon the Oath was forthwith
administred to him; which taken, he that bestowed the
Dignity gave him <i>una Pesconade</i>, a Blow, or Stroke on
the Neck, saying, God assist you in the Performance of
your Promise.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Oath or Vow the Knights professed, was in general,
to relieve and protect Widows, the Fatherless,
Oppressed and Miserable, and to defend the Church of
God; which to keep and perform was esteem’d as meritorious,
as to do all that a Monk, Frier, or Canon Regular
should.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>There</span> is also mention (by Mr. <i>Selden</i>) of consecrating
the Sword, offering it at the Altar, and receiving it again
from thence, as an implicit Kind of taking an Oath.
But as in Peace and great Leisure these tedious Ceremonies
were used, yet it was otherwise in Times of War,
or on a Day of Battle, where Hurry and Throng of
Affairs would not permit; and therefore, as well before
the joining of Battle, as after Victory obtained, it
was usual for the Prince or General in the Field, on
Sight of the Army, to give those whom he thought fit
to advance to that Honour (they humbly kneeling before
him) a Stroke with a naked Sword flatwise upon
their Shoulders, or else to touch their Heads or Shoulders
lightly, without any other Ceremony, except
pronouncing <i>Sis Eques in nomine Dei</i>; to which he adds,
<i>Rise, Sir —— Knight</i>, or in the <i>French</i>, <i>Sus</i>, or <i>Sois, Chevalier,
au nom de Dieu</i>, which we commonly call Dubbing,
the old <i>English</i> Word used for Creating [Consecrating]
a Knight, from <i>doopen</i> to dip, by Bathing.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Another</span> Manner of creating Knights Abroad was,
by Royal Codicils, or Letters Patents (these the <i>Spaniards</i>
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>call <i>Privilegios de Cavelleria</i>) whereupon such Knights are
intitled <i>Equites Codicellares</i>; and these were sent to such
as dwelt in remote Countries, and sometimes, but
rarely, extended so as to make the Degree hereditary.
There is one Example, that by the bare signification
of Letter, without any Ceremonies or Patents
under Seal; <i>Philip</i> IV. of <i>Spain</i>, <i>Jan.</i> 15. 1633. conferr’d
upon all the Captains that behav’d themselves
valiantly in Defence of <i>Mastricht</i> (then lately besieg’d by
the <i>Hollanders</i>) to those that were Gentlemen, the Title
of Knights; and to others, that of Gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Having</span> thus briefly shew’d the various Forms of Creation
of <i>Knights Batchelors</i>, I shall remark what <i>Selden</i> has
observ’d of <i>Knights Bannerets</i> in later Times, wherein he
that was advanc’d to that Honour in the Field, was inducted
between two Senior Knights with Trumpets before
them, and the Heralds carrying a long Banner of his
Arms, call’d a <i>Penon</i>; in which Manner being brought
to the King or Lieutenant, who bidding him good Success,
the Tip of the Banner is cut off, that of an Oblong
it might become a Square, like the Banner of a Baron:
This done, he returns to his Tent, conducted as before.
As for the many and various Formularies at the
Creation of a Knight of the <i>Bath</i>, see Sir <i>Edward Byshe</i>
among his Notes upon <i>Upton</i> and Sir <i>William Dugdale</i>’s
<i>Warwicksh.</i> The Knights of the <i>Bath</i>, at the Coronation of
King <i>Charles</i> II. watched and bathed; they took an
Oath; they were girded with a Sword and Belt; and
lastly, dubbed by the King with the Sword of State.</p>

<p class='c000'>§ 10. <span class='sc'>In</span> the Dignity, Honour and Renown of Knighthood,
is included somewhat of Magnificence more excellent
than Nobility it self; which mounting the Royal
Throne, becomes the Assertor of Civil Nobility, and sits
as Judge at the Tribunal therefore. <i>Knight</i> is noted by
<i>Camden</i> as a Name of Dignity, but <i>Baron</i> is not so.
For if heretofore a Baron had not receiv’d Knighthood,
he was written plainly by his Christian Name, and that
of his Family, without any Addition but that of <i>Dominus</i>,
a Term attributed to a <i>Knight</i>; and in ancient
Charters, the Titles and Names of <i>Knights</i> may be
seen set before <i>Barons</i>. It bestows Gentility not only
upon the meanly Born, but upon his Descendants, and
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>encreaseth the Honour of those well-descended. Hereunto
agrees the Common-Law: If a Villain be made a
Knight, he is thereby immediately enfranchised, and
consequently accounted a Gentleman; agreeable to
the <i>Roman</i> Law, where the Donation of a Gold-Ring
ennobled a Slave. <i>Mœcenas</i> dy’d a Companion
of that Order; even Kings and Princes look upon
it as an Accession to their Honour, their other Titles
shewing Dominion and Power, this their Valour
and Courage. <i>Geysa</i>, King of <i>Hungary</i>, <i>Leopold</i>, Marquis
of <i>Austria</i>, <i>Ottacher</i>, Duke of <i>Stiria</i>, and <i>Frederick</i>,
Duke of <i>Austria</i> and <i>Stiria</i>; <i>Godfry</i>, Duke of <i>Brabant</i>,
with <i>Henry</i> his Son, <i>Peter</i>, King of <i>Arragon</i>, the Emperor
<i>Henry</i> III. our <i>William Rufus</i>, King <i>Edward</i> III. <i>Henry</i>
VI. <i>Henry</i> VII. <i>Edward</i> VI. <i>Lewis</i> XI. <i>Francis</i> I. Kings
of <i>France</i>, and others, received this Dignity at the Time
they enjoy’d their other Titles. And tho’ it is said the
Sons of the <i>French</i> King are Knights as soon as they receive
Baptism, yet are they not judg’d worthy the
Kingdom, unless first solemnly created. And we elsewhere
find, that the Royal Heirs of <i>Arragon</i> were suspended
from that Crown, until they had received the
Honour of Knighthood. And after the <i>Norman</i> Conquest,
our young Princes were sent over to the neighbouring
Kings to receive this Honour. Thus our King
<i>Henry</i> II. was sent to <i>David</i>, King of <i>Scots</i>, and Knighted
by him in <i>Carlisle</i>; and <i>Edward</i> I. at the Age of Fifteen
Years, to <i>Alphonsus</i> XI. King of <i>Castile</i>, for the same
Dignity. In like manner did foreign Princes repair
hither, to receive the Honour from our Kings. As
<i>Malcolme</i>, King of <i>Scotland</i>, and <i>Alexander</i>, Son of <i>William</i>,
King of <i>Scotland</i>, Knighted by our King <i>John</i>,
<i>Anno</i> 1212. So was <i>Alexander</i> III. by our King <i>Henry</i>
III. at <i>York</i>, <i>Anno</i> 1252. and <i>Magnus</i>, King of the <i>Isle of
Man</i>, by the same King. All which sufficiently demonstrate
the great Renown of Knighthood, and the Honour
and Esteem which was ever had for that Order.</p>

  <h2 id='ch02' class='c005'>CAP. II.<br /> <br /><i>Of the Religious Orders of Knighthood in Christendom.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>§ 1.</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c009'>THE
Grounds and Causes of founding <i>Societies</i>
or <i>Knightly Orders</i>, were several and
different, tho’ all terminated in one End.
Among which, principally were these, <i>First</i>, A sincere
Love to <i>Honour</i>, and therein chiefly to excite and promote
<i>Vertue</i> by suitable Rewards; such was the Design
of King <i>Arthur</i>, when he formed himself and other
Martial Men into a Fellowship, which he stiled <i>Knights
of the Round Table</i>. <i>Secondly</i>, To repress the Incursions and
Robberies of the <i>Saracens</i> and <i>Barbarians</i>, to vindicate
the Oppressed, redeem the Enslaved, and to entertain
and relieve Pilgrims and Strangers, which were Part of
the Duties the <i>Knights Hospitallers</i> and <i>Templars</i>, &amp;c.
stood engag’d in. A <i>third</i> Reason was, To Fight in
Defence of the Christian Faith, against Pagans and
Infidels; to enlarge the Christian Territories, and
promote the Service of the Catholick Church: And
indeed their Zeal very much advanced Christianity.
<i>Lastly</i>, When Sovereign Princes perceived themselves
embroiled in Wars or dangerous Factions, the erecting
such an Order or Society was, that they might by such
a Tye restore Peace, quiet all Jealousies, unite Affections,
and secure a lasting Friendship and powerful Assistance,
both for their own and their Country’s Safety.
And to this End were Badges of several Orders devised,
as Pledges of Remembrance to quicken and establish
their Friendship.</p>

<p class='c000'>§ 2. <span class='sc'>These</span> Orders are of Two Kinds, 1. <i>Religious</i>, or
<i>Ecclesiastical</i>; and, 2. <i>Military</i>, or <i>Secular</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>§ 3. <span class='sc'>The</span> Institutions of the latter Sort were after a
while thought too weak to continue, if not sustained
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>by Religion and Piety; and too defective without adjoyning
Ecclesiastical Persons thereunto. Therefore
the Founders, considering Divine Assistance should concur
with Military Industry, began to dedicate these Orders
to the Honour and Worship of God, or to our
Saviour, or to the blessed Virgin, or some other of the
Saints, to gain the Protection and Favour of Heaven,
more easily, as they thought, obtainable by the Prayers
and Offices of the Clergy. Whereupon some in their
Institution joyned Sacred Orders to their Military, and
made Provision for Sacred Persons to pray for their Prosperity
at home, while they were engaged abroad.
Hence King <i>Edw.</i> III. at the first Institution of the <i>Garter</i>,
appointed Thirteen Secular Canons, and Thirteen
Vicars to attend the Celebration of Divine Offices. Upon
the same Account certain Foundations of Divine
Service were erected at <i>Bugey</i>, for the Order of the <i>Annunciads</i>;
at <i>Dijon</i>, for the Order of the <i>Golden Fleece</i>;
and at <i>Mont St. Michael</i> in <i>Normandy</i>, for the Order of
St. <i>Michael</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>§ 4. I shall now deliver a brief Account of the Religious
Orders of Knighthood, proceeding according to
their Antiquity.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>1. <i>The Knights of the</i> Holy Sepulchre <i>in</i> Jerusalem,<br /><i>are accounted the most Ancient</i>.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Dr.</span> <i>Heylin</i> reports this Order to be instituted <i>A. D.</i>
1099. at such Time as the Temple of <i>Jerusalem</i> was regain’d
from the <i>Saracens</i> by <i>Philip</i> King of <i>France</i>. Yet
<i>Favin</i> will have it to be by <i>Baldwin</i> the First, King of <i>Jerusalem</i>;
for while the <i>Saracens</i> possess’d the City, there
were certain Canons Regular of St. <i>Augustin</i>, to whom
they permitted the Custody of the Holy Sepulchre.
These Canons <i>Baldwin</i> made Men of Arms, and <i>Knights
of the Holy Sepulchre</i>, and ordained that they should nevertheless
retain their white Habits, and on the Breast
bear his own Arms, which were <i>Argent a Cross potent:
Or</i>, between <i>four Crosses of the same</i>, commonly call’d
<i>The</i> Jerusalem <i>Cross</i>. Their Great Master was the Patriarch
of <i>Jerusalem</i>. They were to guard the Sepulchre,
fight against the <i>Saracens</i> and Infidels, protect Pilgrims,
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>redeem Christian Captives, hear Mass every
Day, recite the Hours of the Cross, and to bear the
five red Crosses in memory of our Saviour’s Wounds.
Their Rule was confirm’d by Pope <i>Innocent</i> III. Upon
the loss of the Holy Land, these Knights retired to
<i>Perugia</i> in <i>Italy</i>; but retaining their white Habit, chang’d
their Arms to a double <i>red Cross</i>. <i>A. D.</i> 1484. they
were incorporated to the <i>Knights Hospitallers of</i> Jerusalem
then in <i>Rhodes</i>. But <i>A. D.</i> 1496. <i>Alexander</i> VI.
made himself, and the Popes his Successors, Great Masters
thereof, and empower’d the Guardian of the Holy
Sepulchre (his Vicar General) to bestow the same
upon Pilgrims to the Holy Land. <i>Philip</i> II. King
of <i>Spain</i>, endeavour’d to restore this Order in some of
his Dominions, about the Year 1558. himself being
elected Great Master: And another Attempt was made
by the Duke of <i>Nevers</i>, 1615. but these Designs took
no Effect.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>2. <i>Knights Hospitallers of St.</i> John Baptist <i>in</i> Jerusalem.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Before</span> the taking of <i>Jerusalem</i> from the <i>Saracens</i>,
certain Christian Merchants of <i>Naples</i> obtain’d leave
from the Caliph of <i>Egypt</i> to erect a small and convenient
House, for the Entertainment of themselves and
Countrymen, which they built before the Church of
the <i>Holy Sepulchre</i>, together with a small Oratory. To
them repair’d certain Canons of the Order of St. <i>Augustin</i>,
who built another Oratory; but the Confluence
of Pilgrims growing great, they erected a large Hospital,
in the Place where our Saviour celebrated his
last Supper, for the better accommodating devout
Travellers, who for want of a Place to lodge in were
often robb’d and murder’d: So that at length from
their Charity and Hospitality, as also for that they
took St. <i>John Baptist</i> for their Patron, they obtain’d
that Title. It was instituted <i>A. D.</i> 1092. or according
to others 1099. by <i>Gerard</i>, a Native of <i>Thoulouse</i>, who
came to <i>Jerusalem</i> in the Time of <i>Godfry</i> of <i>Bouillon</i>, and
built this Hospital (which became the first Seat of this
Order) dedicated to St. <i>John</i> of <i>Cyprus</i>, Bp. of <i>Alexandria</i>,
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>commonly call’d <i>Johannes Eleemosynarius</i>; and King <i>Baldwin</i>
I. conferred on them large Privileges, permitting
them Arms, and instituted them to be Knights, <i>A. D.</i>
1104. Their Duty was to fight against the Infidels,
and they acknowledged Obedience to the Patriarch of
<i>Jerusalem</i>; but growing rich, they obtained from <i>Rome</i>
to be absolved from that Obedience. Pope <i>Gelasius</i> II.
or <i>Calixtus</i> II. <i>A. D.</i> 1120. confirmed their Rule of living;
and <i>Adrian</i> IV. receiv’d them under the Protection
of the Papal See, being likewise endowed with ample
Privileges, and exempted from Payment of Tithes, by
succeeding Popes, chiefly by <i>Pius</i> IV.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>They</span> took the black Habit of Hermits of St. <i>Augustin</i>,
and lived under his Rule by Grant of <i>Honorius</i> II. <i>Anno</i>
1125. vowing Obedience, Poverty, and Chastity; and
on the Breast of their Habit wore at first a plain Cross
of White Cloth, which was after changed to one with
Eight Points; but in time of War they used a Red
Cassock, bearing the White Cross upon it. Unto
<i>Gerard</i> succeeded <i>Raimund</i>, who digested and enlarged
their Laws and Institutions in the Composition whereof
his Stile was <i>Raimundus Dei gratia servus pauperum Jesu
Christi &amp; Custos Hospitalis Jerusolymitani</i>; but afterwards
he and his Successors had the Title of Great Master of
the Order given him, to denote his Power and Authority.
At this Day he has the Title of Prince of <i>Malta</i> and
<i>Goza</i>; among his Privileges he seals in Lead, as doth the
Pope and Doge of <i>Venice</i>; he acknowledges the Pope
for his Head, and the King of <i>Spain</i> for his Patron; he
had under him in several Kingdoms Priors; some of
whom had also the Addition of Great with us in <i>England</i>
he was stiled <i>Prior Hospitalis; St. Johannis Jerusalem
in Anglia</i>, and by that Title was he summoned to the
Parliament as a Baron of this Kingdom, and at length
for Place and Precedency was ranked the first Baron;
and the greatness of these Knights grew to such height
that <i>temp. H.</i> 3. they had in Christendom 19000 Mannors.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>When</span> <i>Saladine</i> took <i>Jerusalem</i>, these Knights retreated
to <i>Acres</i> or <i>Ptolemais</i>, and that being taken they seized
upon the Island of <i>Rhodes</i>, <i>A. D.</i> 1308. whence they began
to be call’d Knights of <i>Rhodes</i>; but <i>A. D.</i> 1522. being driven,
thence by <i>Solyman</i>, they betook themselves to the Island
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>of <i>Malta</i>, which with <i>Tripoli</i> and <i>Goza</i> were granted to
them in Fee by the Emperor <i>Charles</i> V. <i>A. D.</i> 1530. under
the Tender of one Falcon yearly to the Viceroy of
<i>Sicily</i>, and to acknowledge the King of <i>Spain</i> and <i>Sicily</i>
for their Protectors. In this Isle they continue a Bulwark
to those Parts, and from this their Settlement are
called Knights of <i>Malta</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>3. <i>Knights</i> Templars.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>About</span> the Year 1117, 1118, 1119, or 1120, this
Order took Beginning, <i>Baldwin</i> II. then reigning in <i>Jerusalem</i>;
when Nine Gentlemen, of whom Two of noble
Extraction, <i>Hugh de Paganes</i> and <i>Godfrey de St. Omer</i>, came
in Devotion to the <i>Holy Land</i>; they were called Brothers
of the Militia of the Temple, ordinarily Knights
Templars, from the Habitation assigned them out of a
part of the King’s own Palace, adjoyning to the Temple
of <i>Solomon</i> in <i>Jerusalem</i>. Their first Undertaking was to
guard the most dangerous Ways about that City, against
the Violence and Robberies of the <i>Saracens</i>, which
made them acceptable to all, and for which they had
Remission of their Sins; but for the first Nine Years
they were yet so poor that they lived upon the Alms of
others, wore Clothes bestowed in Charity upon them,
and rode two on one Horse; in memory of which primitive
Poverty their Seal had the Impress, which is represented
in <i>Math. Paris</i>, <i>A. D.</i> 1127. They had
Rules assigned them, drawn up by St. <i>Bernard</i> Abbot of
<i>Clairvaux</i>, by the Appointment of Pope <i>Honorius</i> II. and
<i>Stephen</i> Patriarch of <i>Jerusalem</i>. They made their Vows
of Obedience, Poverty and Chastity, and to live under
the Rules of Canons regular of St. <i>Augustin</i>. Their
Habit was White, to which, in the Time of <i>Eugenius</i> III.
they added the Red Cross, and of the same Form that
the Hospitallers wore (<i>Favin</i> says a patriarchal Cross) and
sowed it on the left Shoulder of the <i>Maulles</i>. These
with the Holy Sepulchre Hospitallers and Teutonicks,
principally supported a long time the Kingdom of <i>Jerusalem</i>;
but when Riches encreas’d, and their Revenues
augmented, they grew proud, fell from the Obedience
of the Patriarch to joyn with the Pope; and at last,
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>1307. all the Knights of this Order in <i>France</i> were, in
one and the same Hour, seized and imprison’d by <i>Philip
le Bel</i>, King of France, with Consent of Pope <i>Clement</i> V.
being charged with most infamous and damnable Crimes.
And in <i>England</i>, <i>Anno 1. Ed. 2.</i> they were also apprehended
afterwards, rendred Convicts, and all their
Possessions seized into the King’s Hands. Howbeit the
Bishop of <i>York</i> commiserating their deplorable Condition
within his Diocess, charitably disposed of them in
Monasteries under his Jurisdiction. Two Years after
many of these Knights were burn’d in <i>France</i>, and
<i>Jaques de la Maule</i>, the last great Master, suffered the
same Fate, having seen, <i>A. D.</i> 1312. his Order by Papal
Authority, condemned and perpetually dissolved;
after which their Lands were annexed to the Hospitallers,
for their Service against the <i>Turks</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Thus</span> they fell, no less famous for Martial Atchievments
in the East, than their Wealth in the West; for
they enjoyed 16000 Lordships in <i>Europe</i>, and a <i>Spanish</i>
Author tells us, their Revenue was Two Millions yearly,
and had in possession 40000 Commanderies, which
occasion’d divers to think they were falsly accused, and
by suborned Witnesses, merely upon the Ambition and
covetous Design of <i>Philip</i> King of <i>France</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>4. <i>Knights of the Order of St.</i> Lazarus.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>These</span> were at the first a Fraternity of Religious
Monks, after which they became Ecclesiastick Knights,
in Imitation of the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre.
Pope <i>Pius</i> V. 1572. stiles it <i>Antiquissimum Charitatis &amp;
Militiæ Christi Ordinem</i>; yet it must be understood as an
Order of Monks, founded by St. <i>Basil</i>, about the time
of <i>Julian the Apostate</i>, <i>A. D.</i> 366. upon a Charitable
Account, <i>viz.</i> to take Care of Leprous Persons (a Malady
frequent in the East) by which they became separated,
even from the Conversation of Men. At
length, through the Incursion of the <i>Barbarians</i>, and
Injury of Time, it lay extinguish’d, but was revived
when the <i>Latin</i> Princes joyned in a Holy League to recover
the <i>Holy Land</i>. And a famous Hospital was
erected at <i>Jerusalem</i>, under the Title of St. <i>Lazarus</i>,
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>for the Reception of Lepers: For in that Time the
Monks of this Order added Martial Discipline to their
Skill in Physick; and for their Services against the Infidels,
begat a great Esteem from <i>Baldwin</i> II. King of
<i>Jerusalem</i>, and some of his Successors. In process of
Time this Order decayed, being suppressed by <i>Innocent</i>
VIII. who united it to the <i>Hospitallers</i> at <i>Rhodes</i>, <i>A. D.</i>
1490. Nevertheless <i>Pius</i> IV. restored it <i>A. D.</i> 1565.
confirming the old, and granting new Privileges, making
his kinsman Don <i>Janot de Chastillon</i> great Master.
<i>Pius</i> V. <i>A. D.</i> 1567. enlarged their Privileges, permitting
them to take one Wife only, to wit, a Virgin, not
a Widow. Lastly, Pope <i>Gregory</i> XIII. <i>A. D.</i> 1572.
bestowed the Great Mastership of this Order upon
<i>Emanuel Philibert</i> Duke of <i>Savoy</i>, and his Successors, and
prescribed them the <i>Cistercian</i> Rule; and accordingly he
had the Investiture and Collation of the <i>Commanderies</i> in
<i>Spain</i> and <i>Italy</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>5. <i>Knights of the</i> Teutonick <i>Order, or</i> Prussia.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>In</span> the Time of the Holy War, a wealthy Gentleman
of <i>Germany</i>, who dwelt at <i>Jerusalem</i>, commiserating
the Condition of his Country-men, coming thither in
Devotion, made his House their Receptacle; afterwards
he erected a Chapel to the Blessed Virgin, whence they
had also the Title of <i>Marian</i> Knights. To him associated
other <i>Germans</i>, and in short time encreasing, they
professed the Military Employments of the <i>Templars</i>,
and followed the Acts of Piety and Charity of the
<i>Hospitallers</i>. <i>A. D.</i> 1190. or 1191. they elected <i>Henry
Walpott</i> their first Master, and the following Year were
confirmed by <i>Celestine</i> III. under the Title of Knights
<i>Teutonicks</i>, or <i>Dutch</i> Knights, of the Hospital of St. <i>Mary</i>
the Virgin, vowing Poverty, Obedience, and Charity,
and following the Rule of St. <i>Augustin</i>. Their Statutes
were composed from those of the <i>Hospitallers</i> and <i>Templars</i>,
and One Article was, <i>That none but</i> Germans
<i>should be of this Order</i>. Their Habit was a White
Mantle, on the Breast a plain <i>Black Cross</i>, but some
make it a <i>Black Cross</i> voided with a <i>Cross Potent</i>.
At <i>Acon</i> they erected another Hospital; but after that
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>City was taken by <i>Saladine</i>, they removed under <i>Hermannus</i>
their Master into <i>Germany</i>, on whom the Emperor
<i>Frederick</i> II. <i>A. D.</i> 1229. and Pope <i>Honorius</i> III. bestowed
<i>Prussia</i>; where having conquer’d that Nation,
and reduced it from Paganism, they built the City of
<i>Maryburgh</i>, and there, <i>A. D.</i> 1340. fixed the chief
Residence of their great Master. This Country they
enjoyed till 1525. that <i>Albertus Brandenburgh</i>, the
Last great Master, made solemn Renunciation of that
Order, and became feudatory to <i>Sigismond</i> I. King of
<i>Poland</i>, who created this <i>Albert</i> first Duke of <i>Prussia</i>:
However, some of the Knights disrellishing this Action
elected another great Master, <i>viz.</i> <i>Albert Wolfang</i>, and
leaving <i>Prussia</i> setled in <i>Germany</i>, where they now reside.
The younger Sons of the <i>German</i> Princes being, for
the most part received into this Order, giving it the
greatest Reputation.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>6. <i>Knights of</i> Mount-Joy.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>These</span> are so called, from a Castle where this Order
was instituted, built upon the Point of a Mountain not
far from <i>Jerusalem</i>, whence the Pilgrims first view’d the
<i>Holy City</i>, and where these Knights lay in Garrison.
Their Habit was White, and the Badge thereof an
<i>Octogonal Cross Red</i>; they vowed Poverty, Chastity,
and Obedience, and followed the Rule of St. <i>Basil</i>;
which Pope <i>Alexander</i> III. <i>A. D.</i> 1180. changed to that
of <i>Augustine</i>. Upon the Loss of the <i>Holy Land</i> they
retired to <i>Spain</i>, and fought against the <i>Moors</i>, and according
to the Places they resided, in had other Names,
in <i>Catalonia</i> and <i>Valentia</i>, <i>Equites de Mongoia</i>, i. e. <i>Mount
Joy</i>; but in <i>Castile</i>, Knights of <i>Monfrac</i>, a Castle there.
When <i>Alphonso</i> IX. King of <i>Castile</i> gave them Lands
they had won from the <i>Moors</i>, the Donation says, <i>To you
Don</i> Rodrigo Gonsales, <i>Master of</i> Monfrac, <i>of the Order
of</i> Mount Joy. Upon the Decay of this Order, <i>A. D.</i>
1221. this Castle was given to Don <i>Gonsalionez</i>, Master
of the Order of <i>Calatrava</i>, by <i>Ferdinand</i> the Saint; and
these Knights were incorporated with them.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>
<h3 class='c010'>7. <i>Knights of St.</i> John <i>of</i> Acon <i>or</i> Acres.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Under</span> the Patronage of this Saint was this Order
erected; they exercised all Duties of Charity towards
Pilgrims, and assumed Arms in imitation of the <i><a id='hosp' name='hosp'></a>Hospitallers</i>;
they followed the Rule of St. <i>Augustine</i>; and
according to <i>Favina</i>, had a Black Habit, upon which
they wore a <i>White Cross patee</i>. After <i>Acon</i> was taken
they removed into <i>Spain</i>, and flourished in the Reign of
<i>Alphonsus</i> the Astrologer King of <i>Castile</i>, about which time
Pope <i>Alexander</i> IV. approved the Order under the conjoined
Title of St. <i>Thomas</i> and St. <i>John</i> of <i>Acon</i>. This
King gave them by his Will all the Furniture of his
House, and much Money; but afterward they dwindled,
and at last were united to the <i>Hospitallers</i>. The Ensign
was a <i>Red Cross</i>, in the middle whereof stood the
Figures of St. <i>John</i> and St. <i>Thomas</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>8. <i>Knights of St.</i> Thomas.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Distinct</span> from the former, yet wearing the same Habit,
as the Knights of St. <i>John</i> of <i>Acon</i>, making the same
Processions, and following the same Rule; their Badge
was a <i>Saltire Gules</i>, (or as others are of Opinion) the
same with that of St. <i>John</i> of <i>Acon</i>, wanting the Figures
in the middle: But <i>Favin</i> reports, this Order was
instituted by King <i>Richard</i> I. after the Surprizal of
<i>Acon</i>; and that these Knights were of the <i>English</i> Nation,
who wore a White Habit and a <i>Red Cross</i>,
charged in the middle with an <i>Escallon</i>, and that
St. <i>Thomas Becket</i> was their Patron. Howbeit, after the
Christians were driven out of the <i>Holy Land</i>, the
Knights of this Order were joined to the <i>Hospitallers</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>9. <i>Knights of St.</i> Blaze.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>These</span> were also called Knights <i>de Sta. Maria</i>; they
were Officers and Servants to the Kings of <i>Armenia</i>;
their Habit was Sky colour with a <i>Cross Gold</i> on their
Breasts; others say a <i>Red Cross</i>, and in the middle the
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>Picture of St. <i>Blaze</i>, their Patron. This Order was at
the height, when the <i>Armenian</i> Kings of the House of
<i>Luzignan</i> kept their Court in <i>Acon</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>10. <i>Knights of the Martyrs in</i> Palestine.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>These</span> took their Denomination from an Hospital in
<i>Palestine</i>, dedicated to St. <i>Cosmus</i> and St. <i>Damianus</i>,
Martyrs; where Acts of Charity were exercised towards
Sick Strangers. Their Profession obliged them to other
Works of Mercy, <i>viz.</i> to redeem Captives, and
bury their Dead. They followed the Rule of St. <i>Basil</i>,
which was confirmed to them by Pope <i>John</i> XXII.
There Badge was a <i>Red Cross</i>, in the middle whereof,
within a Circle, was the aforesaid Two <i>Saints</i>. When

<h3 class='c010'>11. <i>Knights of St.</i> Catherine <i>at Mount</i> Sinai.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>This</span> Order was instituted, <i>A. D.</i> 1063. under the
Patronage of St. <i>Catherine</i>, whose Body was there deposited
in the Church of the Monastery erected and dedicated
to her Name. Their first Institution was to
guard the said Sepulchre, to secure Travellers, defend
the <i>Grecian</i> Pilgrims, and to relieve them with Hospitality.
Their Habit was White, and they lived under the
Rule of St. <i>Basil the Great</i>, vowing conjugal Chastity,
and Obedience to the Abbot of this Monastery, who
was their Superior. But when the <i>Turks</i> obtained these
Countries, these Knights were ill treated and driven away,
and the Order almost abolished; nevertheless
some Shadow remains for such as travel to visit the
Holy Sepulchre at <i>Jerusalem</i>, do now and then pass to
this Monastery at Mount <i>Sinai</i>, where in imitation of
the <i>Padre Guardian</i> of <i>Jerusalem</i>, the principal Monk in
this Covent makes them Knights of St. <i>Catherine</i> over
her Tomb, with the like Questions and Formulary as
used at the Holy Sepulchre. These Knights now wear
upon the left side of their White Habit the Cross of <i>Jerusalem</i>,
and Instrument of St. <i>Catherine</i>’s Martyrdom;
but according to others, the middle of the Wheel is
pierced with a Sword.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>12. <i>Knights of St.</i> Anthony <i>in</i> Æthiopia.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>After</span> the Death of St. <i>Anthony</i> the Hermite, who
dy’d about the Year 357. many of his Disciples remaining
near <i>Æthiopia</i>, follow’d his Example and Manner
of Life, and their Successors liv’d in great Austerity
and Solitariness in the Desart (therefore call’d <i>Anchorites</i>)
till the Year 370. when ’tis said <i>John</i>, Emperor
of <i>Æthiopia</i>, erected them into a Religious Order of
Knighthood, under the Title and Protection of St. <i>Anthony</i>,
Patron of his Empire, and bestow’d upon them
great Privileges; and being thus instituted, they receiv’d
St. <i>Basil</i>’s Rule, and cohabited in Monasteries.
Their Habit is black, with a blue Cross <i>Tau</i>. Their
chief Seat is in the <i>Isle of Meroe</i>; but in other Parts of
<i>Æthiopia</i> they have great Numbers of Convents, and no
less than 2000000 of annual Revenue. The eldest Sons
of Nobles and Gentlemen cannot be admitted, but the
second Sons may; and if a Man (except a Physician)
have three Sons, he is bound to assign one of them to
be of this Order. Their Vow is to observe conjugal
Chastity; to die in Defence of the Christian Faith;
to guard the Empire; to obey their Laws and their
Superiors; and to go to War when and wheresoever
commanded: Moreover, they take an Oath not to
fight in Wars between Christians, nor receive Holy
Orders, or marry without License. They are of two
Sorts: One employ’d in the Wars, the other who being
Old are exempted from Military Services, and retire
themselves under the Title and Profession of
Monks, to the Abbies where they first took their Habit;
before which they must serve three Years against
the <i>Arabian</i> Pyrates about the <i>Red Sea</i>, three Years against
the <i>Turks</i>, and three against the <i>Moors</i> upon the Borders
of <i>Borneo</i>. When they come to be admitted into
their Abbey, they are introduced in their Military
Habit, of which being disrob’d, the Religious one is
put on, <i>viz.</i> a black Gown reaching down to the
Ground, lined with blue, having a blue Cross fix’d to
the Breast, and over that a black Cowle; they are
afterwards led to the Church, and there make their
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>Profession. <i>Philip</i> VII. Son to the Founder, enlarg’d
their Lands and Privileges, and added a Border of

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> <i>Italy</i>, <i>France</i> and <i>Spain</i>, there are a Sort of Monks
that have the Title of Knights of St. <i>Anthony</i>, which
observe the Rule of St. <i>Augustin</i>, and they wear a

of these wear a double St. <i>Anthony</i>’s Cross of blue Satin,
the one above the other. Their chief Seat is at
<i>Vienne</i> in <i>Dauphine</i>, of which Place the General of the
Order bears the Title of Abbot, the Monastery being
erected into an Abbey 1297. in Honour of St. <i>Anthony</i>,
whose Body was translated thither from <i>Constantinople</i>;
and all other Places built in Honour of his Name, were
made subject to him <i>A. D.</i> 1523. <i>Morœus</i> calls them
<i>The Hospitallers of St.</i> Anthony, and says they begun in

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Great Masters have their chief Seat and Convent

i. e. may sit at the Table with the Pope, who defends
them as Benefactors to the Church, and Founders
of the <i>Lateran</i> Cathedral at <i>Rome</i>. As Subjects to

give Titles of Counts and Princes to their own Fraternity,
and take upon them the restoring to <i>Honours</i>, of
legitimating <i>Bastards</i>, making <i>Doctors</i>, <i>Poets Laureats</i> and
<i>Publick Notaries</i>. This Order is under the Protection of
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>the Virgin <i>Mary</i> and Patronage of St. <i>George</i>; and they
profess Obedience and conjugal Chastity; they wear a

the first call’d Collered or Grand Crosses, wearing a

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>This</span> is the principal Order in <i>Spain</i>, and had its
Title of <i>Don Raniro</i>, King of <i>Leon</i>, who about the Year
826. at <i>Clavigio</i>, by the Assistance of St. <i>James</i> (said to
appear upon a white Horse, bearing a Banner with a

better Life, and approv’d on by the said Pope <i>Alexander</i>,
who receiv’d them into the Protection of the Papal
See, and gave them the Rule of St. <i>Augustin</i>, the Form
of holding Chapters, of electing their <i>Masters</i>, of <i>Treves</i>,
and thirteen Commendadores of Houses, and of the
Visitors; and in short very large Privileges, together
with the Monastery of St. <i>Lorjo</i>, situate in <i>Galicia</i> near
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span><i>Sanctiago</i>; and the Prior and Canons thereof were incorporated
into this Order.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Their</span> Ensign is a <i>red Cross</i>, which the Knights
wear upon their Breast, terminating like the Blade of
a Sword, the Hilt crosletted and fashion’d after the ancient

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Their</span> Habit is a white Mantle close before, on the
Breast whereon is placed the said Cross, made of Silk or
Cloth, and they are obliged to wear it upon their

Gold likewise.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>When</span> the <i>Moors</i> were driven out of <i>Spain</i>, and the

obtain’d it under the Title of Administrator, which
was granted to King <i>Ferdinand</i>; and his Son <i>Charles</i> V.
annex’d it with all its Rights, <i>&amp;c.</i> to his Successors
in the Kingdoms of <i>Castile</i> and <i>Leon</i>. Since which, the
Kings of <i>Spain</i> now enjoy the Administration of this
Order, and carry that Title and Stile in the Inscription
upon the Great Seal thereof, which holds the Royal
Arms of <i>Spain</i>, upon a Cross that filleth all the Shield,

<h3 class='c010'>15. <i>Knights of St.</i> Saviour <i>in</i> Arragon.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>These</span> were instituted <i>A. D.</i> 1118. by Don <i>Alphonso</i>,
call’d <i>Emperor</i> of <i>Spain</i>, <i>King</i> of <i>Navarre</i>, <i>Arragon</i>, &amp;c.
chosen out of the <i>Spanish</i> and <i>French</i> Nobility that
assisted in his Wars. He form’d them into a Society,
the better to enable him to drive the <i>Moors</i> out of
<i>Saragossa</i>, and the whole Territory of <i>Arragon</i>. Their
Rule of living was the <a id='cist' name='cist'></a><i>Cistercian</i>, and somewhat conformable
to the <i>Knights Templars</i>. When the <i>Moors</i> were
driven out of <i>Spain</i>, their rich <i>Commanderies</i> were at
length united to the Crown.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Their</span> Habit was a white Mantle, on the Breast

<h3 class='c010'>16. <i>Knights</i> d’Avis <i>in</i> Portugal.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Don</span> <i>Alphonso Henriquez</i>, first King of <i>Portugal</i>, took
from the <i>Moors</i>, <i>A. D.</i> 1147. the City of <i>Evora</i>, and to
strengthen it, sent thither several gallant Commanders,
who assum’d the Title of Knights of St. <i>Mary</i> of <i>Evora</i>,
putting themselves under the Protection of our blessed
Lady. Not long after they were call’d <i>d’Avis</i>, from a
Castle upon the <i>Portuguese</i> Frontiers, conquer’d from
the <i>Moors</i>, whither they transplanted themselves. It was
confirm’d by Pope <i>Innocent</i> III. <i>A. D.</i> 1204. under the
Rule of St. <i>Benedict</i>, and therefore in some Papal Rules
call’d of St. <i>Benedict d’Avis</i>. The <i>Knights</i> profess <i>conjugal
Chastity</i> and <i>Obedience</i>. <i>Anno</i> 1213. they submitted
themselves to the <i>Rule</i>, <i>Statutes</i> and <i>Visitation</i> of the
Order of <i>Calatrava</i>; but in the Time of <i>John</i> of <i>Portugal</i>
(natural Son to <i>Pedro</i> King of <i>Portugal</i>) seventh Great
Master <i>d’Avis</i>, they cast off their Acknowledgments to
<i>Calatrava</i>, and never after submitted to them; and afterwards,
when the Crown of <i>Portugal</i> fell into the
Hands of <i>Philip</i> II. King of <i>Spain</i>, this Order was govern’d
according to the Statutes of <i>Portugal</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their Badge is a <i>green Cross, Flory</i>, (such as the <i>Knights</i>
of <i>Alcantara</i> us’d to wear.) They must be Gentlemen
by Extraction, both of the Father’s and Mother’s side.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>17. <i>Knights of St.</i> Michael<i>’s Wing in</i> Portugal.</h3>

<p class='c011'>About the Year 1165. others say 1171. Don <i>Alphonso</i>,
who founded the Order <i>d’Avis</i>, founded this also after
his obtaining a notable Victory over the <i>Moors</i> and <i>Albara</i>
King of <i>Sevil</i>, in which Battle St. <i>Michael</i> the Archangel
is said to appear on the right Side of <i>Alphonso</i>, and
fight against them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their Investiture, <i>&amp;c.</i> was the same with <i>d’Avis</i>.
It is now grown out of Use, but the Mastership remains
with the King of <i>Portugal</i>.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>
<h3 class='c010'>18. <i>Knights of St.</i> Gereon.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>This Order was establish’d by <i>Frederick Barbarossa</i> the
Emperor; others say by <i>Frederick</i> II. and consisted only
of the <i>German</i> Nation. They follow’d the Rule of
St. <i>Augustin</i>, and wore a white Habit, whereon was
sow’d a black Patriarchal Cross, set on a little green
Hill.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>19. <i>Knights of St.</i> Julian de Pereyro, <i>or of</i> Alcantara.</h3>

<p class='c011'>They had the first Appellation from St. <i>Julian de Pereyro</i>,
a Town in <i>Leon</i>, where they had a Monastery
built for them by <i>Ferdinand</i> II. King of <i>Leon</i> and <i>Galicia</i>,
who in his Diploma of Privileges granted thereunto
1176. stiled himself Protector of this Society of
Knights. In the Approbation-Bull of Pope <i>Alexander</i> III.
their Chief is called Prior; but in that of Pope <i>Lucius</i>
III. he is stiled Master of <i>Pereyro</i>. They used a Secular
Habit, modest and grave, and the Ecclesiasticks a Clerical
Habit, with a Shred of Cloth and a Scapulary, to
distinguish them from other Seculars and Ecclesiasticks.
They observed the Rule of St. <i>Benedict</i> moderated, as it
was convenient for the Exercise of Arms against the
<i>Moors</i>, for which End it was instituted. Their ancient
Badge was a <i>Pear-tree Vert</i>, in Allusion to the Name.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Occasion of altering the first Appellation was
upon change of their Habitation. Pope <i>Adrian</i> VI. annex’d
this Mastership, together with those of St. <i>James</i>
and <i>Calatrava</i>, to the Royal Crown of <i>Castile</i> for ever.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>20. <i>Knights of</i> Trugillo <i>or</i> Truxillo <i>in</i> Spain.</h3>

<p class='c011'>This Order is so call’d from the City of <i>Trugillo</i> in
<i>Estremadura</i>, but when, or by whom founded, or their
Badge, is unknown. Some suppose these Knights the
same with that of <i>Alcantara</i>; ’tis evident they were in
being <i>A. D.</i> 1227. when ’tis pretended the Master of
<i>Alcantara</i> took <i>Trugillo</i> from the <i>Moors</i>, and plac’d there
a Brotherhood of Knights. But it seems these Knights
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>of <i>Truxillo</i>, were a distinct Order several Years before,
and ’tis not unlikely that they might be incorporated into
that of St. <i>Julian de Pereyro</i>, and by this Means the Order
of <i>Alcantara</i> acquired the Towns of <i>Trugillo</i>, <i>Sancta
Cruz</i>, &amp;c. which <i>Alfonso</i> IX. King of <i>Castile</i> had given
them. They were to be of Noble Descent, and make
proof of their Gentility; they were obliged to be near
the King’s Person, and to attend him in all Martial Expeditions,
maintaining always Two Horses and Servants
in Readiness.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>21. <i>Knights of</i> Calatrava.</h3>

<p class='c011'>This Order was instituted in <i>Castile</i> by <i>Sanchio</i> III.
and so called from <i>Calatrava</i>, a Frontier Castle of <i>Castile</i>
and <i>Toledo</i>, which the <i>Moors</i> took, <i>A. D.</i> 714. compounded
of the <i>Arabick</i> <i>Cala</i> a Castle, and the <i>Spanish</i>
<i>Travas</i> Manacles, with which the <i>Moors</i> fettered the
Christians; 400 Years after which, upon the Recovery
of the Town from the <i>Moors</i>, it was given to the Knights
<i>Templars</i>; but they, unable to stop the mighty Conquests
of the <i>Moors</i>, the said <i>Sanchio</i> by Proclamation
promis’d the Inheritance to any who would undertake
the Defence of it, being the Key of the Kingdom of
<i>Toledo</i>. At length <i>Raymond</i> of <i>Barcelona</i> (formerly a
Knight, then a <i>Cistercian</i> Abbot) by the Perswasion of
<i>Velasquez</i>, accepted the Proffer, and had the Donation,
<i>A. D.</i> 1158. and fortifying it by the Help of his Associates,
this Order arose, call’d at first <i>Militia de Calatrava</i>.
Upon the account of the Fertility of the Place,
20000 Men and their Families were drawn from the
neighbouring Countries to settle there, so that the
<i>Moors</i> never after attempted it. They remain’d under
their own Masters till Pope <i>Adrian</i> VI. annex’d it to the
Crowns of <i>Castile</i> and <i>Leon</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>22. <i>Order of the Holy Ghost at</i> Rome.</h3>

<p class='c011'><i>Marquez</i> calls them <i>Brothers of the Hospital of the Holy
Ghost</i>, who tho’ not invested with Swords and Spurs,
are nevertheless reckoned among the Military Orders,
because bound to certify their Gentility before Admittance.
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>Their chief Seat is the Sumptuous Hospital of
the Holy Ghost, founded at <i>Saxia</i> near the River <i>Tyber</i>
at <i>Rome</i>, by Pope <i>Innocent</i> III. <i>A. D.</i> 1198. or 1201.
But the Ancient Foundation was the Hospital of the
<i>Holy Ghost</i> at <i>Montpelier</i> in <i>France</i>, tho’ this other became
the Principal. They profess Chastity, Poverty, and
Obedience, living under the Rule of St. <i>Augustine</i>, and
have a Master. Their Ensign is a <i>White Patriarchal Cross
with Twelve Points</i>, sowed to their Breast, and on the
left side of their Black Mantle.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this Hospital, Care is taken for the nursing and
bringing up exposed Children, curing Infirmities, Entertainment
of Strangers for Three Days, relieving the
Poor, and the like Works. Their Revenue is about
24000 Ducats <i>per</i> Day, having great Commandaries in
<i>Italy</i>, <i>Sicily</i>, <i>Spain</i>, <i>France</i>, <i>Burgundy</i>, <i>Germany</i>, and elsewhere.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>23. <i>Knights of St.</i> George d’Alfama.</h3>

<p class='c011'>So named from a Town in <i>Tortosa</i>, were instituted,
<i>A. D.</i> 1201. received Approbation from the Papal See,
<i>A. D.</i> 1363. and <i>A. D.</i> 1399. was united to the Order
of our Lady of <i>Montesa</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>24. <i>Knights of</i> Christ <i>in</i> Livonia, <i>or of the Sword-bearers</i>.</h3>

<p class='c011'><i>A. D.</i> 1186. <i>Mainard</i> first preach’d Christianity to the
<i>Livonians</i>, and erected the Bishoprick of <i>Riga</i>; but his
Successors meeting with many Difficulties, <i>A. D.</i> 1200.
<i>Albert</i>, then Bishop of <i>Livonia</i>, instituted this Order in
Imitation of the Knights <i>Teutonicks</i>, with design to extirpate
Idolatry, and promote the Gospel. He prescribed
to these Knights the <i>Cistercian</i> Rule and Habit, <i>viz.</i> a
long White Mantle and Black Hood; on the Breast was
the Figure of a <i>Red Sword</i>, or rather <i>Two plac’d in Saltire</i>,
whence they had the Title of <i>Ensiferi fratres</i>, or <i>Brethren
Sword-bearers</i>. Their Statutes were something like the
Knights <i>Templars</i>, and they vowed Obedience and
Chastity. Pope <i>Innocent</i> III. confirmed this Order,
which became fully instituted, <i>A. D.</i> 1203. but because
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>they could not of themselves accomplish their End.
About the Year 1237, they were united to the <i>Teutonick</i>
Order, and submitted to their Rule and Habit, by
whose Help they overcame the <i>Livonians</i>, and brought
them to the Christian Faith; thenceforward the Great
Master of <i>Livonia</i> acknowledged him of <i>Prussia</i> their
Superior, until <i>Walter de Pletemberg</i>, their Great Master,
separated this Order from their Obedience to the <i>Teutonick</i>.
Finally, <i>A. D.</i> 1561. <i>Gothard de Ketler</i>, the last
Great Master, following the Example of the Great
Master of <i>Prussia</i>, became subject to the Crown of <i>Poland</i>,
surrendering to King <i>Sigismond</i> II. the City and
Castle of <i>Riga</i>, and all the Lands, Charters, Privileges,
<i>&amp;c.</i> of this Order, receiving in exchange the
Dukedom of <i>Curland</i>, to him and his Heirs for ever;
so the Order expired after 357 Years continuance.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>25. <i>Knights of</i> Jesus Christ <i>in</i> Italy <i>or</i> France.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>St.</span> <i>Dominick</i> descended of the Family of the <i>Guzmans</i>
in <i>Spain</i>, instituted this Order, <i>A. D.</i> 1206. principally
to fight against the <i>Albigenses</i>, then call’d Hereticks. He
prescribed to them a White Habit, and for their Badge a
<i>Cross flory, quarterly, sable and argent</i>. The Work being
done with the <i>Albigenses</i>, they devoted themselves wholly
to spiritual Warfare; and afterwards, upon admitting
Widows and Virgins into their Order, they became
called <i>Fratres seu Sorores de Pœnitentia B. Dominici</i>, whose
Rule Pope <i>Innocent</i> VI. confirm’d <i>circa An.</i> 1360.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>26. <i>Knights of St.</i> Mary de Merced. <i>in</i> Aragon.</h3>

<p class='c011'><i>James</i> I. of <i>Aragon</i>, being sometime a Prisoner to
<i>Simon</i> Earl of <i>Montfort</i> in <i>France</i>, where he suffered
much Hardship, and being moved with the insufferable
Miseries the Christians endured under the Slavery of
the <i>Moors</i>, made a Vow to the Blessed Virgin, That
when delivered himself, he would endeavour the Redemption
of such Christians as the <i>Moors</i> had made Captives,
and accordingly laid up great Summs for the Performance;
and afterwards, by the Council of <i>Raymond
de Penafort</i>, his Confessor, and <i>Pedro Nolasco</i>, a Noble
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>Chevalier, he founded in <i>Barcelona</i> this Order of <i>la
Nueva Merced</i>, so named by the Virgin, who, as they
reported, appeared to them all in one and the same
Hour, directing the Institution. In <i>Anno</i> 1358. I find
it called also <i>Ordo beatæ Eulaliæ</i>, from St. <i>Eulalia</i> the
Virgin and Martyr, buried at <i>Barcelona</i> in the Church
bearing her Name. This Order began on the Day of
St. <i>Laurence</i>, in <i>August</i>, <i>A. D.</i> 1218. in the Fifth Year of
that King, which Day they annually commemorate.
They were to gather Alms, and go in Person to redeem
Christian Slaves; which Work prospered so well, that
<i>Velasco</i> (the first General or Head) set at Liberty 400
within the Space of Six Years after its Foundation. Their
Habit was a Coat and Scapular of course white Cloath,
garnished with Cordons and Ribbons, wherewith they
fast’ned it about their Necks, and from the upper-end
thereof issued a Cap that covered half their Head:
The Monks wore their Coats and Scapulars reaching
down to their Feet; but those of the Knights were
much shorter. <i>A. D.</i> 1251. King <i>James</i>, the Founder,
granted unto all the Fraternity, that they should wear
upon their Scapulars the Arms of <i>Aragon</i>, <i>viz.</i> <i>Or</i> 4 <i>Pales
Gules</i>, and above that the White Cross of the Church of
<i>Barcelona</i> in a red Field, with Two Coats joined together
<i>per fess</i> in one Shield, which came afterwards to
be encompassed with a <i>Bordure</i>, which the Knights
wore on their Scapulars, but the Monks on their
Mantles, and both upon their Breasts. Disputes arising
among themselves, they were incorporated with the
Knights of <i>Montesa</i>; so that, ever since, the whole Fraternity
have been only Priests. The Master General
hath his Residence at <i>Barcelona</i>, by the Decrees of Pope
<i>Clement</i> V. and <i>John</i> XXII. To conclude, they now
collect great Sums of Money, send out their Agents
yearly, chiefly to <i>Algiers</i> and <i>Fess</i>, and for the Redemption
of Christian Captives, and have from the Time of
their Institution followed their proposed Ends with all
religious Care and Faithfulness.</p>

By their Statutes, besides fighting against the <i>Moors</i>, they
are obliged to say, continually, the Rosary of our
Blessed Lady. Their Rule of Living was that of
St. <i>Dominick</i>; and their Ensign the <i>Figure of our Lady
of the Rosary upon a Cross flory, quarterly, argent and
sable</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>28. <i>Knights of St.</i> Mary the Glorious, <i>in</i> Italy.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Their Author was <i>Bartholomeo de Vincenza</i>, a Friar
Preacher, or <i>Dominican</i>, afterwards Bishop of that City.
The End he chiefly designed, was to procure Peace to
<i>Italy</i>, then much disquieted by Civil Wars. It was instituted,
<i>A. D.</i> 1233. called <i>Generalis Devotionis annus</i>,
and approved and confirmed by Pope <i>Urban</i> IV. <i>A. D.</i>
1262. and the Rule of St. <i>Dominick</i> prescribed them,
who are obliged to take into their Care Widows and
Orphans, and endeavour to beget Concord among such
as are at Variance. Their Habit is a White Tunick or
Cassock, and a Mantle of Russet; some make their
Badge which they wear upon their <a id='breast' name='breast'></a>Breast <i>a purple Cross
patee bordered with Gold</i>, others make it <i>a purple Cross
patee, with Two Stars in chief</i>; but <i>Marquez</i>, that has
writ of the Order of Knighthood, gives it an <i>Octogonal
Cross</i>, like that of <i>Malta</i>. They profess Obedience and
Conjugal Chastity; but are forbid to wear Spurs or
Bridles of Gold: They are commonly called <i>Cavaleri
de Madona</i>, and reside at <i>Bolonia</i>, <i>Modena</i>, and other <i>Italian</i>
Cities; and because they have no Monasteries, but
dwell in their own Houses at Ease and Plenty, they
were called <i>Fratres Gaudentes</i> or <i>Hilares</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>29. <i>Knights of St.</i> James, <i>in</i> Portugal,</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Were</span> instituted, <i>A. D.</i> 1310. by <i>Denys</i> VI. King of
<i>Portugal</i>, in honour of St. <i>James</i>, under whose Protection
he became victorious in divers Battles against
the <i>Moors</i>, and at length quieted his Kingdom by the
Assistance of these Knights. It was not long after
its Institution ere this Order flourished, through the
Privileges the Founder bestowed, and the Approbation
of Pope <i>Nicholas</i> IV. and others his Successors. The
Knights profess Conjugal Chastity, Hospitality and Obedience,
and none are admitted till they make proof
of their Gentility by Blood. Their Ensign is a <i>red
Sword</i>, formed like that of St. <i>James</i> of <i>Galicia</i>; the
Habit White, and the only difference between them
lies in a little Twist of Gold which these of <i>Portugal</i>
draw about their Sword. At <i>Alcasar de Sul</i> was their
Principal Convent, which they afterwards removed to
<i>Dalmela</i>, where it yet continues. Their Statutes, <i>&amp;c.</i>
are much the same with those of St. <i>James</i> in <i>Galicia</i>,
whereupon some erroneously have confounded them.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>30. <i>Knights of our</i> Lady, <i>and of St.</i> George <i>of</i> Montesa.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>This</span> Order succeeded into the Lands and Possessions
of the Knights <i>Templars</i> in <i>Valentia</i>, as the Knights
<i>Hospitallers</i> did into those of the <i>Templars</i> in <i>France</i>, <i>Italy</i>,
and <i>England</i>; for <i>James</i> II. King of <i>Aragon</i> and <i>Valentia</i>,
refusing to give their Revenues to the <i>Hospitallers</i> (which
as other Princes had done) gave them to the Convent
of <i>Montesa</i>, where had been placed both Knights and
Friars of the Order of <i>Calatrava</i>; and excusing himself
to Pope <i>John</i> XXII. <i>A. D.</i> 1317. he instituted
this Order in the City <i>Valentia</i> (nevertheless subject to
that of <i>Calatrava</i>) and made choice of the Town of
<i>Montesa</i>, to give the Knights both Name and Habitation,
whom he obliged to defend his Kingdom against the
<i>Moors</i>. Their College, dedicated to St. <i>George</i>, was
built the following Year, and their Statutes confirmed
by the said Pope <i>John</i>, who gave them the <i>Cistercian</i>
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>Rule. Upon their Habit is White, and the Badge a
plain <i>red Cross</i>, which they wear on their Breasts. <i>A. D.</i>
1399. the Order of St. <i>George d’Alfama</i> was incorporated
to it. And the Great Office of Master hereof is in the
King of <i>Spain</i>, who hath the Revenue of Thirteen
Commandaries belonging thereunto to the Value of
23000 Ducats <i>per annum</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>31. <i>Knights of</i> Christ <i>in</i> Portugal.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>These</span> sprang also from the Ruin of the Knights
<i>Templars</i>, whose confiscated Estates King <i>Denys</i>, sirnamed
<i>Penoca</i>, desired of Pope <i>John</i> XXII. might not
be disposed out of his Kingdom, in regard of the
great Evils the Neighbouring <i>Moors</i> in <i>Algarves</i>, did his
Kingdom; and forasmuch as the Town of <i>Castro Marin</i>
was a Frontier, and commodious to resist the Enemy,
he moved for Licence to institute an Order of Knights
therein, and offer’d his Holiness the Rents and Jurisdiction
thereof, which accordingly was granted by the
Pope, and dedicated it to the Honour of God, and
the Exaltation of the Catholick Faith, under the Title
of the <i>Military Order of our Lord Jesus Christ</i>, as is alledged
from the miraculous Apparition of our Saviour crucified,
seen by the King when he went out to fight the
<i>Moors</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>32. <i>Knights of the</i> Passion of Jesus Christ.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>This</span> Order was erected by <i>Charles</i> King of <i>France</i>,
(tho’ it made no Progress) and our King <i>Richard</i> II. with
a large Design exceeding all other Religious Orders,
except those of St. <i>John of Jerusalem</i> and Knights <i>Templars</i>.
They were to renew the Memory of our Saviour’s
Passion, to extirpate Pride, Covetousness and
Luxury, to make way for the Reconquest of <i>Jerusalem</i>
and <i>Palestine</i>, and for the Subversion and Confusion of
Enemies of the Faith. A MSS. in the <i>Arundelian</i> Library,
reckons up Twenty Causes for the Necessity of its
Institution, which are too long to be inserted; and
altho’ it was dedicated to our Saviour, yet the Blessed
Virgin was look’d upon as a principal Mediatress and
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>Advocate of this Holy Chevalry. Their Governments
in the principal Convent, were to be debated
by Five Councils, in the Presence of the Prince:
1. The <i>Quotidian</i> Council, consisting of Twenty-four:
2. The Particular consisting of about Fourty:
3. The Grand Council consisting of Eighty. 4. The
General Chapter held every Year. And, 5. The
Universal Chapter to be held every Fourth or Sixth
Years, consisting of a Thousand Knights of the
Chevalry. The Principal Officer was the <i>Grand Justiciary</i>,
the next the <i>Grand Bailiff</i>: In the Chief City,
and in every City and Castle of theirs, one was to administer
Justice called a <i>Potestate</i>. In the general
Chapter was to be an Officer called the <i>Senator</i>, and in
the Universal Chapter a <i>Dictator</i> with Coadjutors and
Assistants.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> the principal Convent were to be Ten Executers of
Justice, and Four styled Charitable Commissaries, whose
Office was, to provide for Widows and Orphans; and
whereas this Order was made up of Eight several Languages,
and as many Notaries, who put on the Habit
of the Brothers; for the greater Regularity of their
Order, they were to bind themselves by Oath to
the Observance of these Three Points, Obedience to
Sovereigns, Poverty of Spirit, and Conjugal Chastity.
They were allotted for their Maintainance, the Possession
of Cities, Castles, <i>&amp;c.</i> Gold, Silver, <i>&amp;c.</i> and all
to be in common, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>There was to belong to the Castle or Principal Convent
a Church of marvellous Structure; it was design’d
Fifty Cubits in breadth, without any Pillars, a Hundred
Cubits long, and in height Twenty-five; likewise
an Hospital, where the Widows of the Holy Chevalry
should attend upon the Sick and Infirm; a Baptistery or
Font, for the Baptizing the Children of the Knights;
a stately Palace, with a great Hall and large Consistories,
to contain the Prince and Council with their Retinue;
with a large and delightful Cloister for the Canons
and Clerks; together with a very spacious Palace,
to entertain the Princes of the <i>West</i> when they came
that Way, either to War, or upon Pilgrimage: In
fine, there was to have been Three chief Halls, wherein
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>they might dine together; with distinct Lodgings and
Habitations, Wine-Cellars, Granges, Granaries, Stables
for Horses and Cattel, Easements, Mills, Cisterns,
Baths, and all other Necessaries for the Chevalry. Their
Habit was to denote the Passion of Jesus.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Dress they were obliged to was a hansome Cloth
Coat of a civil Colour, reaching down half way their
Legs, and girt with a large Girdle of Silk or Leather
Two Fingers broad, the Buckle of Black Horn, the
Tongue and Garnishing of the Holes, Tin; to have
Red Chaperons or Caps, representing the Blood of our
Saviour; over their said Coats, a Mantle of White
Cloth or Serge, which from the Shoulders downward
was to be open on both Sides along the Arms,
and in that Part before the Breast a <i>Cross</i> of red Cloth
or Serge Two Fingers broad, extending to the Breadth
and Length of that Part of the Mantle; the <i>Cross</i> of the
Prince’s Mantle was to be edged round with a Gold
Fringe about half an Inch broad; there were to be
some other small Distinction as to the Shape of the
Cross upon the White Habit to be used by this Holy
<i>Chevalry</i>. Their Arms in a Banner were <i>Argent</i>, upon a
<i>Cross Gules; a Compass of Four convex semi-circles, conjoyning
Four intervening Angles alternately sable</i> (in Allusion to
the Agony of our Lord) charged with an <i>Agnus Dei
Or, the Compass and Cross both fimbriated Gold, with a little
red Bordure</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> Times of extraordinary Danger, and great Battles,
they were to have another singular and solemn
Banner; every Knight was to have his Esquire armed
at all Points, a little Valet for his Lance and Helmet, a
bigger to carry his Mail, and a third to lead his Sumpter;
Five Horses, and Four Servants were to attend
him in all Warlike Expeditions, and Two or Three
Horses and Servants in all Times of Peace. The Number
of these Knights of the <i>Holy Chevalry</i> was 1000
or 1100.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>33. <i>The Order of the</i> Brician <i>Knights in</i> Sweden.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Was</span> founded, <i>A. D.</i> 1366. by an holy and famous
Queen of that Kingdom which they repute St. <i>Bridget</i>,
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>the Aim of whose Profession was to oppose Heresy,
secure the Confines of the Kingdom, bury the Dead,
succour Widows and Fatherless, and to keep up Hospitality.
Their chief Ensign was a <i>Blue Octogonal Cross,
and under it a Tongue of Fire</i>, the Symbol of Love and
Charity.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>34. <i>Knights of St.</i> Maurice <i>in</i> Savoy.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>This</span> Order took its rise upon the Retreat of <i>Amadeus</i>
VIII. Duke of <i>Savoy</i>, into the Desart of <i>Ripaille</i>,
near the Lake of <i>Geneva</i>, and was conferr’d by him,
<i>A. D.</i> 1434. on Ten of his Courtiers, who retir’d
with him, as well as to preserve the Memory of
St. <i>Maurice</i>, the Patron of <i>Savoy</i>. Nine Years after its
Institution, the Founder was elected Pope, <i>A. D.</i> 1439.
and assumed the Name of <i>Felix</i> V. Nine Years after
that he resigned the Chair, and retir’d to his Solitude
in <i>Ripaille</i>, where he died, <i>Jan.</i> 7. 1451. and lies buried
at <i>Lausanna</i>. The Order continued not long after
his Death; but Duke <i>Emanuel Philibert</i> restored it,
<i>A. D.</i> 1572. and the Dukes of <i>Savoy</i> are their Grand
Masters.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>35. <i>Knights of the</i> Holy Ghost,</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Were</span> instituted by Pope <i>Paul</i> II. <i>A. D.</i> 1468. under
the Title of Brethren of the Hospital of the <i>Holy Ghost</i>,

<h3 class='c010'>36. <i>Knights of St.</i> George <i>in</i> Austria <i>and</i> Carinthia.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>The</span> Emperor <i>Frederick</i> III. others say <i>Rudolphus</i> of
<i>Hapsburgh</i>, first Founder of the Greatness of the House
of <i>Austria</i>, instituted this Order, A. D. 1470. chiefly
to guard the Frontiers of <i>Germany</i>, <i>Hungary</i>, <i>Austria</i>,
<i>Stiria</i>, and <i>Carinthia</i>, and to suppress the Insolency of
the Turks, since which these Knights have gallantly
behaved themselves. The Great Master was advanc’d
to the Honour of a Prince; and the Castle of <i>Mildstad</i>
in <i>Carinthia</i> was given him for his Seat, where was
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>founded a Cathedral Church of Canons, under the
Rule of St. <i>Augustin</i>. Their Ensign is the Arms of
St. <i>George</i>, a <i>red Cross</i>, and their Habit white; they profess
Conjugal Chastity and Obedience, and have the
Emperors for their Protectors.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>There</span> are also <i>Cavalleros de San Jorge en Alemania</i>, an
Order erected by the Emperor <i>Maximilian</i>, 1494. upon
the like Design with the former; it was confirmed by
Pope <i>Alexander</i> VI. and is under the same Profession and
Protection as the other. There Ensign is a <i>red Cross</i>,
with a <i>Crown of Gold</i> on the top of it; they were otherwise
called <i>crowned Knights</i>; for after they had served a
Year, they and their Heirs have a peculiar right of
Adorning their Shields and Helms with a Crown; the
Occasion was upon a notable Victory obtained against
the <i>Turks</i>, who confessed that a Man on Horseback supposed
to be St. <i>George</i>, put them into that Fear and
Disorder as to quit the Field.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>37. <i>Knights of St.</i> George <i>at</i> Rome.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>These</span> were instituted by <i>Alexander</i> VI. 1498. or, as
others say, by Pope <i>Paul</i> III. at whose Death it became
extinct. They dwelt at <i>Ravenna</i>, their Province, and

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Pope</span> <i>Leo</i> X. <i>A. D.</i> 1520. instituted this Order to

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Pope</span> <i>Pius</i> IV. erected this Order 1560. He created of
them at first 375. but they encreased to 535. He granted
them very considerable Endowments, and preferr’d them

they were his Courtiers, and had the Charge of carrying
his Chair on their Shoulders when he went abroad.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>41. <i>Knights of St.</i> Stephen <i>at</i> Florence.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>This</span> Order was founded in imitation of the Knights
of <i>Malta</i>, 1561. by <i>Cosmo de Medicis</i> II. Duke of <i>Florence</i>,
afterwards first Duke of Tuscany, in honour of St. <i>Stephen</i>,
Pope and Martyr, the Patron of the City of
<i>Florence</i>, and in memory of the Battle on the 6th of
<i>August</i>, (St. <i>Stephens-day</i>) at <i>Marciano</i>, where overthrowing
the Assertors of Liberty, he laid the Foundation
of his Grandeur. <i>Pius</i> IV. confirmed it under the
Rule of St. <i>Benedict</i>, which was afterwards enlarged
with many Emoluments and Privileges, by the succeeding
Popes. The Knights vow’d Conjugal Chastity and
Charity, in relieving the Afflicted, Obedience to their
Masters the Great Dukes of <i>Tuscany</i>. The chief Place
of their Residence was at <i>Pisa</i>, where the Founder erected
a Church and Convent, as a Nursery for Persons
skilful in Maritime Affairs, but since it is transferred to
<i>Cosmopoli</i> in the Isle of <i>Ilva</i>. Their Habit is a long
Mantle of White Chamlet trimmed with Red, and on
the left part of their Breast a <i>Cross</i> (like that of <i>Malta</i>)
<i>of red</i> or <i>crimson Satin border’d with Gold</i>; it is daily worn
on their Cloaks, and on their Military Garments, and
about their Necks in a Ribbon on Festival Days. This
Order (like the <i>Maltese</i>) also consists of Knights, Priests
and Servants. The Priests wear the <i>Cross of red Taffaty</i>
without a Bordure, the Servants the <i>Cross</i> of St. <i>Anthony</i>
only. The Statutes were reformed by <i>Ferdinand</i> Duke
of <i>Tuscany</i>, Son to the Founder, and approv’d, 1590.</p>

constituted this Duke Grand Master, the same Year,
for their greater Honour, he united them under the
Title of St. <i>Maurice</i> and St. <i>Lazarus</i>, and appointed the
Dukes of <i>Savoy</i> Hereditaries and Masters, and oblig’d
them to furnish out two Gallies for the Service of the
Papal See, to be employ’d against Pyrates. Upon this
Union, the Knights had assign’d them for Habit a
Gown of Crimson Tabby, with wide Sleeves, a long
Train, and edg’d with white Taffaty, and a Cordon
with a Tassel of White and Green fix’d to the Collar.
The Badge is, <i>A green Cross ancree of St.</i> Laurence, <i>plac’d
Saltirewise, surmounted with the white Cross pornelle of St.
Maurice</i>, which the Knights wear either in a Gold
Chain, or any colour’d Ribbon. And the said Duke
founded for the Knights two fair Convents, one at
<i>Nice</i>, the other at <i>Turin</i>, and bestow’d on them all the
Revenues within his Territories, formerly appertaining
to the Order of St. <i>Lazarus</i>. The Dukes of <i>Savoy</i>, as

out of certain Ecclesiastical Benefices in <i>France</i>)
the Commandaries and Hospitals of St. <i>Lazarus</i> in that

Enemies of the Romish See. The Feast of the Patroness
is the 16th of <i>July</i>; <i>Philibert Nerestang</i>, a valiant
Knight of St. <i>Lazarus</i>, was elected their first Master

Palace of St. <i>John Lateran</i> for their Convent, and the
City and Port of <i>Civita Vecchia</i> to make their Arsenal;
with an Island adjacent, together with the Government
of his Gallies. Their Institution was for the Exaltation
of the <i>Roman</i> Church, and to check or suppress
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>the <i>Turks</i> roving in the Mediterranean. There are three
Sorts of this Order, 1. <i>Knights Gentlemen</i>, Laicks.
2. <i>Knights Gentlemen</i>, Priests and benefic’d. 3. <i>Knights
Chaplains</i>, or <i>Servants of Arms</i>. All of these wear on the

Sfortia</i>. To give it the greater Lustre, they divided
the World among them; <i>Charles</i> took the North and
West Parts, <i>Adolph</i> the Eastern, and the other had the
South, where they were personally to found Convents
and invest Knights. Duke <i>Charles</i> began his Institution
of this Order under the Rule of St. <i>Francis</i>, in <i>Olmutz</i>
the Metropolis of <i>Moravia</i>, the Year aforesaid, and dedicated
it to the blessed Virgin and St. <i>Michael</i>: But
what Progress the others made in their pious Resolutions,
History is silent. It has been likewise styl’d,
<i>Conceptionis Ordo &amp; Militis Virginis annunciatæ</i>. <i>Anno</i> 1612.
several illustrious Princes of divers Countries entered
themselves into that Order at <i>Vienna</i>. It was approv’d
by Pope <i>Paul</i> V. and confirm’d by Pope <i>Paul</i> VIII. 1624.
The Design of its Institution was, to establish Peace and
Concord among Christian Princes and their Subjects;
to release Captives, and deliver the Oppressed out of
the Hands of the Infidels.</p>

have stretch’d too far, yet <i>William</i> of <i>Malmsbury</i> is of
Opinion, he was worthy to have been celebrated by
true and faithful Historians, and not false and spurious
Tales. He it was that long prop’d up his declining
Country, and inspir’d Martial Courage into his Subjects,
the <i>Saxons</i>, in twelve pitch’d Battles having overcome,
and conquer’d divers Countries. He liv’d in
so great Repute and Renown, that worthy Knights
came from all Parts to his Court, as a Seminary of Military
Discipline, to demonstrate their Valour in point
of Arms. This gave him Occasion to select out of
these, and his own Subjects, some say Twenty Four
of the most Valiant, which he united in a Fellowship;
and to avoid all Controversy upon Precedency, caus’d a
Round Table to be made, whence the Order had its
Appellation. He admitted not only <i>Britains</i>, but Strangers;
and their Qualifications were to be Persons of
Nobility, Dignity, and renown’d for Vertue and Valour.
The Place where they were instituted was <i>Windsor</i>;
and those others of Note, where he and his
Knights assembled, were at <i>Caerleon</i> in <i>Monmouthshire</i>,
<i>Winchester</i>, and <i>Camelot</i> in <i>Com’ Somerset</i>; and their time
of convening was <i>Whitsuntide</i>. In <i>Winchester</i> Castle was
a large Round Table, call’d (and affirm’d to be) King
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span><i>Arthur</i>’s; or at least set up in the room of one more
ancient, which was destroy’d in the rebellious Times
of Forty One, with other Reliques there. The Articles
of their Profession (Number 12) are set down by
Sir <i>William Segar</i>. We find no authentick Proof what
Badge they bore, notwithstanding the Report that
King <i>Arthur</i> had a Shield nam’d <i>Pridwin</i>, wherein the
Virgin <i>Mary</i> was depicted. His Sword and Lance had
also their Names, one being call’d <i>Caliburne</i>, the other
<i>Irone</i> or <i>Rone</i>. It’s not remember’d that this Order surviv’d
the Founder, but rather that it expir’d with
him, most of these Knights perishing with him at the
Battle of <i>Kamblan</i>, now <i>Camelsford</i>, in <i>Cornwall</i>, where
tho’ he kill’d his Enemy <i>Mordred</i>, yet he dy’d <i>A. D.</i> 542.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>It</span> may be noted, that the like Round Table grew in
Estimation shortly after the <i>Norman</i> Conquest, being permitted
at Haslelades, Tilts and Turnaments, <i>temp. Steph.</i>
and <i>R. I.</i> And <i>Roger Mortimer</i>, Earl of <i>March</i>, kept the
Celebration of the Round Table (consisting of One
Hundred Knights, and as many Ladies) with Tilting
at <i>Kenelworth</i>-Castle, in <i>Com’ Worcest’</i> 7 <i>Ed.</i> I. And King
<i>Edward</i> III. designing to restore it, held a Just at <i>Windsor</i>
in the 18th Year of his Reign; and in the 19th
ordain’d it annually to be kept there at <i>Whitsontide</i>.
But it was thought fit upon divers Accounts to forbid
these Assemblies, and in particular 16 <i>H.</i> III. at <i>Shrewsbury</i>,
when the King went to meet <i>Llewellin</i> Prince of
<i>Wales</i>, and in 36 <i>H.</i> III. and at many other times.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>2. <i>Knights of the</i> Oak <i>in</i> Navarre,</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Were</span> instituted by <i>Garcia Ximenes</i> of the Blood of
the <i>Goths</i>, who had formerly retir’d from the World to
a solitary Life, but relinquish’d it to command an Army
rais’d by the <i>Navarrois</i>, to deliver themselves from
the Oppression of the <i>Moors</i>. As he was marching to
encounter them, <i>A. D.</i> 722. there appear’d to him
from the Top of an Oak the Sign of the Cross, ador’d
by an infinite Number of Angels. On giving Battle to
the Infidels he gain’d a remarkable Victory, and the
People elected him their King; and he in thankfulness
to God erected this Order, investing his Nobles therewith,
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>and oblig’d them to defend the Christian Faith,
and acknowledge Obedience to his Successors, Kings
of <i>Navarre</i>. Time has eclips’d this Order.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>3. <i>The Order of the</i> Gennet,</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Was</span> Founded by <i>Charles Martel</i>, in Memory of the
famous Battle near <i>Tours</i>, <i>A. D.</i> 726. where he overthrew
385000 <i>Saracens</i> and <i>Moors</i>, with their General
<i>Abdiramo</i>; and to reward those who had well-behav’d
themselves in this Action. The great Number of rich
Gennet Furr, (Ermine has since gain’d the better value)
as also the Creatures themselves taken alive among the
Spoils, was the Occasion of assuming the Name: But
others impute it to Gennets, a kind of neat-shap’d
Horses, whereof not unlikely a great Part of the Founder’s
Cavalry consisted. The Knights were Sixteen in
Number, and were accounted the first Order of this Nature
among the <i>French</i>, which continu’d till the Institution
of the <i>Star</i>, when it was laid aside, tho’ some
<i>French</i> Authors question if ever the Order was in being.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>4. <i>The Order of the</i> Crown-Flower,</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Erected</span> by <i>Charles</i> the Great, Son of King <i>Pepin</i>,
<i>A. D.</i> 802. to reward the <i>Frizons</i>, who had behav’d
themselves valiantly in his Armies, and to encourage
others to emulate their Vertue. It was so call’d from
its Ensign, <i>viz.</i> an Imperial Crown embroider’d with
Gold. The Knights were invested with the Military
Belt and a Box on the Ear.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>5. <i>The Order of the</i> Dog <i>and</i> Cock.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>That</span> there was such an Order in <i>France</i> is related
by several Writers, but they give no certain Account
of its Institution.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>
<h3 class='c010'>6. <i>The Order of St.</i> Andrew, <i>or the</i> Thistle, <i>in</i> Scotland,</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Is</span> reported by <i>John Lesley</i>, Bishop of <i>Ross</i>, to take
beginning from a bright Cross in Heaven, in Fashion of
that whereon St. <i>Andrew</i> suffer’d Martyrdom, which
appear’d to <i>Hungus</i>, King of the <i>Picts</i> (and to the <i>Scots</i>
whom <i>Achaius</i> King of <i>Scotland</i> sent to his Assistance)
the Night preceding the Battle with <i>Athelstan</i> King of
<i>England</i>; over whom prevailing, they went in Solemn
Procession to the Kirk of St. <i>Andrew</i>, to thank God and
his Apostle for their Victory, promising that they and
their Posterity would ever bear the Figure of that Cross
in their Ensigns and Banners. <i>Favin</i>, in his <i>Theatre of
Honour</i>, relates it to be instituted upon the famous
League, Offensive and Defensive, made between <i>Achaius</i>
and <i>Charlemain</i> King of <i>France</i>; to preserve the Memory
of which Alliance, <i>Achaius</i> added the <i>Tressure of Flowers
de Lys</i> to the Lyon, and took for Device the <i>Thistle</i> and
<i>Rue</i>, which he compos’d into a Collar of his Order;
and for his Motto, <i>Pour ma Defence</i>: Yet doth <i>Menenius</i>
make these the Symbols of two different Orders, one
of the <i>Thistle</i>, whence the Knights were so styl’d, and
the Motto, <i>Nemo me impune lacessit</i>; the other call’d <i>Sertum
Rutæ</i>, or <i>The Garland of Rue</i>: Nevertheless to both
these Collars hung one and the same Jewel, <i>viz.</i> the
Figure of St. <i>Andrew</i>, bearing his Cross before him.
<i>But there are some</i>, saith the same Author, <i>that refer the
Institution of the</i> Thistle (the Badge of the <i>Scotch</i> Kingdom
from the Times of <i>Achaius</i>) <i>to the Reign of</i> Charles VII.
<i>King of</i> France, <i>when the Amity was renew’d between both
Kingdoms</i>. Lastly, Others place its Foundation 1500.
Their principal Ensign is a Gold Collar, compos’d of
Thistles interlink’d with Anulets of Gold, and pendant
thereto St. <i>Andrew</i> with his Cross, and this Epigraph,
<i>Nemo me impune lacessit</i>. Their solemn Meeting
was annually on St. <i>Andrew</i>’s Day, in the Church of
the Town dedicated to his Name: During the Festivity,
the Knights were richly habited, and wore their
Parliament Robes, having fix’d on their left Shoulders
an Azure Roundle, charg’d with a Saltire Argent,
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>or St. <i>Andrew</i>’s Cross enfil’d in Centre, with a Crown
compos’d of <i>Flower de Luces Or</i>. For the ordinary and
common Ensign, the Knights us’d a Green Ribbon,
whereat hung a Thistle of Gold, crown’d with an Imperial
Crown, within a Circle of Gold, containing the
last nam’d Epigraph; and now of late they have sew’d
to their left Breast an Irradiation (like that of <i>The
Knights of the Garter</i>) over a Saltire Silver, the Irradiation
charg’d with a Blew Roundle of St. <i>Andrew</i>’s Cross.
Their Number consisted of Thirteen, in Allusion to our
blessed Saviour and the Twelve Apostles.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>7. <i>Knights of</i> our Lady of the Star,</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Owe</span> their Original to <i>Robert</i> the Devout of <i>France</i>,
<i>A. D.</i> 1022. to manifest his strict Devotion to the blessed
Virgin. They were in Number Thirty, inclusive
of the Chief. Their Seat was in the noble and ancient
House of St. <i>Owen</i>, call’d <i>de Chichey</i>, near St. <i>Denys</i>
in <i>France</i>. This Order was of no long continuance,
for being much sully’d and disgrac’d (during the Civil
and Foreign Wars) by the Imitation of Persons that
had neither Birth nor Merit to recommend them, King
<i>Charles</i> VII. took Occasion to efface it <i>A. D.</i> 1455. by
delivering up, in a Chapter, the Ensign that he wore
to the Chevalier <i>du Guet</i>, Captain of the Night-watch
in <i>Paris</i>, the Lords and Princes throwing it off after it
had receiv’d that Mark of Infamy; tho’ some alledge
it declin’d upon the Erection of <i>The Order of St.</i> Michael,
as the <i>Star</i> supplanted that of the <i>Gennet</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>8. <i>The Order of the</i> Lilly <i>in</i> Navarre, <i>or of St.</i> Mary <i>of the</i> Lilly,</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Was</span> founded <i>A. D.</i> 1048. by <i>Garcius</i> VI. King of
<i>Navarre</i>, in Honour of the blessed Virgin <i>Mary</i>, after
his Recovery from a languishing Sickness. Others relate,
that prevailing against the <i>Moors</i>, he made a Feast
in Honour of the blessed Virgin, at which he instituted
this Order, electing his Brothers and Sons among the
first Knights. It was esteem’d the most Illustrious of
all <i>Spain</i>, and consisted of Thirty Eight Knights, extracted
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>out of the ancientest Blood of <i>Navarre</i>, <i>Biscay</i>
and <i>Old Castile</i>. The Kings of <i>Navarre</i> were their Chief.
They promis’d, at their Institution, to expose their
Lives and Fortunes in Defence of the Christian Faith,
the Conservation of the Crown, and Expulsion of the
<i>Moors</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>9. <i>The Order of the</i> Sword <i>in</i> Cyprus,</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Was</span> erected 1195. by <i>Guy</i> of <i>Lusignan</i>, King of <i>Jerusalem</i>
and <i>Cyprus</i>, after he had purchas’d that Isle of
our King <i>Richard</i> I. in Commemoration of so fortunate
a Plantation of 15000 Persons whom he brought thither.
Some question the Truth of this; however all
assent, its Founder was one of the <i>Lusignan</i> Family. The
Collar was compos’d of round Cordons of white Silk,
woven into Love-Knots, interlac’d with the Letters
S and R. Beneath this Collar hung an Oval of Gold,
whereon was perfigur’d a Sword, the Blade enamell’d
Silver, the Hilt Gold, and about the Oval this <i>Motto</i>,
<i>Securitas Regni</i>. <i>Micheli</i> says, <i>Pro Fide Servanda</i>, and <i>Gothofredus,
pro integritate tuenda</i>. Their Festivity was <i>Ascension-Day</i>,
whereon the Founder gave it (in the Church
of St. <i>Sophia</i>, the Cathedral of <i>Nicosia</i> in <i>Cyprus</i>) to
his Brother <i>Amaury</i>, and to Three Hundred Barons
establish’d in that his new Kingdom. There were
Eight Kings of <i>Cyprus</i> of the <i>Lusignan</i> Line, Great Masters;
but when this Isle fell into the Hands of the
<i>Turks</i>, this Institution ceas’d.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>10. <i>The</i> Bear <i>in</i> Switzerland,</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Was</span> instituted <i>A. D.</i> 1213. by the Emperor <i>Frederick</i>
II. in Favour of the Abbot of St. <i>Gall</i> in <i>Swaben</i>,
who had assisted him in gaining the Empire. These
Knights wore a Collar of Gold, at the End whereof
hung a Bear Gold, mounted on an Hillock enamell’d
with Black, in Honour of St. <i>Ursus</i> of the <i>Theban</i> Legion,
who was martyr’d before the Temple of the Sun
at <i>Soleurre</i> in <i>Switzerland</i>. It was also call’d <i>The Order of
St.</i> Gall, from the Name of the Patron (a <i>Scotch</i> Gentleman,
and the Apostle of <i>Swaben</i>) of the Place where
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>it receiv’d its Appellation. The Abbot whereof, for the
Time being, had Power to confer this Honour, which
was done by girding with the Military Belt (the Sword
being first consecrated) and putting on the Collar. It
continu’d ’till the <i>Switzers</i> became a Common-Wealth;
and then the Castles of the Nobles being dismantled, it
was laid aside.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>11. <i>The</i> Broom-Flower <i>in</i> France,</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Took</span> its Original from <i>Lewis</i> of <i>France</i>, to honour
the Coronation of his Queen <i>Margaret</i>, <i>A. D.</i> 1234. Their
Habits were Cassocks of White Damask, and Violet Chaperons;
the Collar compos’d of Broom-Flowers Proper,
interlac’d with Flowers <i>de Lys</i>, hanging thereat a
Cross <i>Florence</i> Gold, to which was added this Inscription,
<i>Exaltat Humiles</i>; the Founder accounting the
Broom the Symbol of Humility. Their Number was
at the Sovereign’s Pleasure, and this Order continu’d
till the Death of King <i>Charles</i> V. Some say <i>Charles</i> VI.
instituted it, and others deny the being of any such
Order.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>12. <i>The</i> Ship <i>and</i> Double Crescent <i>in</i> France.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Such</span> an Order was of Old, in Honour of the great
Atchievements of that Nation, tho’ by whom founded
is unknown. <i>Favin</i> affirms, St. <i>Lewis</i> erected this after
he had instituted the <i>Broom Flower</i>, to animate the Nobility
to accompany him in his Expedition to <i>Africa</i>,
1269. Their Badge was alluding to the Name of the
Order, the Figure of a Ship Pendant in an Oval of
Gold; and expir’d with St. <i>Lewis</i> after the first Class
of Knights; but its Honour was kept up by <i>Charles</i>,
Brother of St. <i>Lewis</i>, and flourish’d in <i>Sicily</i> with his Successors,
until the Kings of <i>Arragon</i> obtain’d that Kingdom.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>13. <i>Knights of St.</i> James <i>in</i> Holland.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>This</span> Order was erected by <i>Florentius</i>, Earl of <i>Holland</i>
and <i>Zeland</i>, and Lord of <i>Friseland</i>; and he, <i>A. D.</i>
1290. bestow’d the Ensigns of it, in his Palace at the
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span><i>Hague</i>, upon Twelve of his chief Nobility, among which
was <i>Lancenot</i> Lord <i>Hamilton</i>, Embassador from the King
of <i>Scots</i>. They were invested with a Collar of Gold,
or Military Belt of Silver gilt, set off with Six Escallops,
whereat was hung the Picture of St. <i>James</i> the
Apostle.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>14. <i>The Order of the</i> Swan <i>in</i> Cleveland.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>If</span> ever any such was, it has been effac’d long since.
Yet <i>Favin</i> says, the Princes of <i>Cleve</i> have born the <i>Swan</i>
for their Order, Devise, Crest and Supporters, to preserve
the Memory of the <i>Knight of the Swan</i>, whose Romance
he sets down. And further reports, That <i>Charles
Gonzaga</i> of <i>Cleve</i>, Duke of <i>Nevers</i>, had a Design to re-establish
it.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>15. <i>The Knights of</i> Jesus <i>at</i> Rome,</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Were</span> instituted by Pope <i>John</i> XXII. at <i>Avignon</i> in
<i>France</i>, <i>A. D.</i> 1320. as a Temporal Prince, being Lord
Paramount of St. <i>Peter</i>’s Patrimony. <i>Paul</i> V. much augmented
it. Their Badge is a plain Cross Gules, inclos’d
within a Cross patee Or, hanging at a Gold
Chain. Pope <i>Clement</i> IX. 1668-9. treated Three of
the Embassadors from the <i>Swiss Cantons</i> with the usual
Ceremonies, himself putting on the Chains, and the
Captains of his Guards girding their Swords about
them.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>16. <i>The</i> White Eagle <i>in</i> Poland,</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Was</span> instituted by <i>Ladeslaus</i>, King of <i>Poland</i>, to honour
the Marriage of his Son <i>Casimire</i> the Great, with
<i>Anne</i> Daughter of <i>Gedimer</i> Duke of <i>Lithuania</i>, 1325. The
Ensign was a white Eagle crown’d.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>17. <i>The Order of Knights</i> de la Banda <i>in</i> Castile,</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Was</span> set up by <i>Alphonsus</i> II. King of <i>Leon</i> in <i>Castile</i>,
in the City of <i>Victoria</i>, <i>A. D.</i> 1332. (or <i>Palencia</i> 1330.
or <i>Burgos</i> 1368. according to others) not long before
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>his Coronation, the better to secure himself against his
Enemies. Soon after the Solemnity was celebrated at
<i>Burgos</i>, in the Monastery of St. <i>Mary Royal</i>, where the
Candidates, conducted by the King to the Altar, and
depositing their Arms, spent the Night in Watching
and Prayer. The Morrow after Mass, they were invested
with a red military Belt or Ribbon, of four Fingers
broad, which came a-cross the Body over the right
Shoulder, and so under the left Arm, and was the Ensign
from whence they took their Denomination. This
Order was chiefly to Honour the Nobility; and at first
none were admitted but the younger Sons of Noblemen
[excluding elder Brothers] or Persons well-descended,
or Esquires, who had serv’d in Court or
Camp Ten Years at least. It was anciently of great
Esteem, and Kings have vouchsafed to take its Ensign;
but at length it was disus’d.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>18. <i>The Order</i> de la Calza,</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Instituted</span> at <i>Venice</i> <i>A. D.</i> 1400. from the Example
of the <i>Knights</i> de la Banda, in Honour of the Inauguration
of Duke <i>Michele Steno</i>. It consisted of a Society
of particular Noblemen and Gentlemen, who voluntarily
met together, and elected a Chief among themselves.
They took an Oath to observe their Articles,
part whereof was, the Honour of the City, where
noble and splendid Regales were made; and with such
like magnificent Divertisements did they entertain King
<i>Henry</i> III. of <i>France</i>, and other noble Personages. It
receiv’d the greater Lustre, by the Addition of several
Italian Princes; and the most conspicuous Families
were receiv’d into it. Their Habit, on Solemn Days,
was a Crimson Senator’s Vest appearing very splendid.
Their Ensign, a Sun in a Sheild painted in their Banners.
It arriv’d to such Profuseness, that in 1590. it
was wholly laid aside.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>19. <i>The Order of St.</i> Mark <i>in</i> Venice,</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Is</span> here reckon’d, because the Knights are dignify’d
with a Title and particular Ensign of Honour at their
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>Creation. The Ceremony is after the Manner of <i>Knights
Batchelors</i>, by Dubbing with a Sword, and their Title
a bare Mark of Honour, having no Laws or Statutes,
or particular Obligations enjoyn’d. It had the Denomination
from St. <i>Mark</i> the Evangelist, whose Body
was translated to <i>Venice</i>, 828. and became the Titular
Angel and Guardian of that City, his Picture being
display’d in their Banners. The exact Time of its Institution
is not certainly determin’d. The Badge that
adorns these Knights, is, a Gold Chain put over their
Shoulders at their Creation, whereat depends a Medal,
on one side whereof is the Symbol of St. <i>Mark</i>, <i>viz.</i> a
winged Lyon, holding in his right Paw a drawn
Sword, and in his left an open Book, with this Motto,
<i>Pax tibi Marce Evangelista meus</i>. On the Reverse, the
Duke surviving is beautify’d with a particular Impress.
Sometimes represented on his Knee, receiving
a Standard from the Hands of St. <i>Mark</i>. This Medal
is worn on a Cross enamell’d Blew. The Duke confers
this Honour, either privately in his Chamber, or publickly
in a full College. The Senate have the Power
of creating this Order; and they who receive it by
their Sanction, the Dignity is greater than from the
Hands of the Duke himself. Absent Persons are invested
by Letters Patents; and to aggrandize their Honour
and Title, style themselves <i>Knights of St.</i> Mark.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>20. <i>The Order of the</i> Seraphims, <i>or</i> Seraphick Knights,<br /><i>otherwise sirnam’d of</i> Jesus,</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Was</span> begun by <i>Magnus</i> IV. King of <i>Sweden</i> 1334. in
Memory of the Siege laid to the Metropolitan City of
<i>Upsala</i>. The Collar was compos’d of Seraphims and
Patriarchal Crosses.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>21. <i>The Order of the</i> Sword <i>and</i> Military Belt <i>in</i> Sweden.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>By</span> whom or when founded we have no Memoirs.
The Collar made up of Swords, with Belts twining
round them (the Symbol of Love and Justice) the
Swords somewhat inclining towards the Point, and so
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>joyn’d Two and Two, Point to Point, plac’d round in
a Circle.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>22. <i>The Order of the</i> Knot <i>in</i> Naples.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>When</span> <i>Lewis</i>, King of <i>Hungary</i>, warr’d against <i>Joan</i>,
Queen of <i>Naples</i>; not so much to dispossess her of the
Kingdom, as to revenge his Brother <i>Andrew</i>’s Death,
whom this <i>Joan</i>, his Wife, had strangled 1351. On the
26th of <i>May</i>, the Queen and <i>Lewis</i> Prince of <i>Tarantuni</i>,
being crown’d King and Queen of that Realm on the
same Day, in Commemoration of so pacifick an Union,
and to tear up all their Enmities, the Prince instituted
this Order; into which enter’d, at that Time, Threescore
and Ten Lords. Their Habit was White, and
their Ensign a Knot (the Emblem of Love and Friendship)
intermixt with Gold. This Order expir’d in a
short Time.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>23. <i>Knights of the</i> Annunciade <i>in</i> Savoy.</h3>

<p class='c011'><i>Ame</i> VI. Earl of <i>Savoy</i>, instituted this Order, under
the Title of <i>The Collar</i> 1362. in Honour of the Fifteen
Divine Mysteries of the <i>Rosary</i>. <i>Favin</i>, on a mistaken
Ground, calls it <i>The Order of the Snares of Love</i>, in regard
its Founder had receiv’d of his Lady, a Bracelet
made of the Tresses of her Hair, plaited in Love-knots,
and that the four Letters, afterwards interlac’d by the
Founder, should signifie <i>Frappes</i>, <i>Entres</i>, <i>Rompes</i>, <i>Tout</i>.
It is conspicuous enough at the first Erection it was
call’d of <i>The Collar</i>, and so remain’d till <i>Charles</i> III. or
<i>Le Bon</i> Duke of <i>Savoy</i>, bestow’d on it the Title of <i>The
Annunciation</i>, from the Picture of the Annunciation
which he annex’d to <i>The Collar</i>, 1518. The Founder appointed
the Number of his Knights to be Fifteen,
among whom Sir <i>Richard Musard</i>, an <i>Englishman</i>, is recorded
1434. and 1568. their Number was encreas’d to
Twenty, that being solely lodg’d in the Breast of their
Sovereign. <i>Riene</i> Castle, in <i>Buger</i>, was their principal
Seat; they had a Chartreuse to entertain Fifteen Priests
to celebrate Fifteen Masses to the Honour of the Fifteen
Joys of the blessed Virgin, and to the Soul’s Health of
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>these Knights; and here were their Ceremonies and
Chapters held, until <i>Charles Emmanuel</i> I. exchang’d it
and other Places for the Marquisate of <i>Saluces</i>, 1607. on
the Anniversary of the Feast and Celebration of the
Order (being fix’d upon the Day of the Annunciation)
were translated first to the Church of St. <i>Dominick</i> at
<i>Montmeiller</i>, and afterwards by him to the Hermitage of
<i>Camaldule</i>, upon the Mountain of <i>Turin</i> call’d <i>l’Eremo
Assis</i>. The ancient Collar was of Gold, Three Fingers
broad; in barbarous Characters were ingraved these
Letters, F E R T, and one Knot (commonly call’d the
<i>Savoy Knot</i>) at the end of each <i>Fert</i>; which, with
Three other Knots entwin’d one within another, made
up the Circumference <i>pendant</i> at the Collar without any
Figure. These old Characters were suppos’d to be the
Initials of <i>Fortitudo ejus Rhodum tenuit</i>, alluding to <i>Amadeus
le Grand</i>, who so valiantly defended <i>Rhodes</i> against
the <i>Turks</i>, 1310. But that this was long before the
Devise of the House of <i>Savoy</i>, is manifest from the
Coins of <i>Lewis de Savoy</i>, Baron <i>de Vaud</i>. who dy’d
1301. the Monument of <i>Thomas de Savoy</i>, who dy’d
1233. whereon was lying at the Feet of his <a id='portrait' name='portrait'></a>Portraiture
a Dog with a Collar about his Neck, inscrib’d <i>Fert</i>, as
an integral Word, and from a Brass Coin of the said
Earl’s, on the Reverse whereof are Two Knots of the
Model before spoke of, and the Word <i>Fert</i> in the midst.
There is the Ectype of a Silver Coin of <i>Peter de Savoy</i>,
(who erected in <i>England</i> the noble Pile of that Name
in the <i>Strand</i>, <i>temp. H.</i> III.) wherein is represented the
Devise <i>Fert</i> in <i>Gothick</i> Characters, the true Interpretation
of which Word cannot be explain’d. This ancient
Collar is still in vogue and daily worn, but now called
<i>The little Collar</i>, fashion’d of Gold or Silver gilt, about
an Inch broad, and of different weight. The Knights
wear it about their Necks, close to the Collar of their
Doublet. Duke <i>Charles</i> III. as he much restor’d the
Splendor of this Order, <i>Anno</i> 1518. introduc’d the
larger one, only worn upon high Days. It weighs
about Two Hundred Crowns, and is compos’d of the
Word <i>Fert</i>, interwoven with Knots, severed with Fifteen
Roses of Gold, whereof Seven are enamell’d with
White, and Seven with Red, and border’d with Two
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>Thorns. The Figure of the Annunciation is enamell’d in
various Colours, <i>pendant at three Chainets</i> to another Rose-colour’d
both White and Red. He first appointed the
great Mantle of Crimson Velvet, his own being furr’d
with Ermines, but the rest of the Knights with Miniver,
fring’d and border’d with <i>Savoy Knots</i> in fine
Gold; under this Mantle is worn a Surcoat of fine Damask.
Duke <i>Emanuel Philibert</i>, his Son, alter’d the
Colour of the Mantle to Azure, and lin’d it with White
Taffaty, of which Silk he made the Surcoats. <i>Charles
Emanuel</i> chang’d the Mantle into an <i>Amaranthus</i> or Purple
Colour, seeded with Roses and Flames in embroidery
of Gold and Silver, and lin’d with Cloth of Silver
tissu’d Blue, now in use; under which, instead of
the White Taffaty Surcoat, is now worn a White Satin
Suit embroider’d with Silk, the Hose gather’d upwards
in the fashion of Trouses.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>24. <i>The</i> Thistle <i>in</i> France,</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Was</span> instituted on <i>New-Year’s Day</i> 1370. by <i>Lewis</i> II.
Duke of <i>Bourbon</i>, upon his Marriage with <i>Anne</i>, Daughter
to the Count <i>Daulphine</i> in <i>Auvergne</i>. The first Solemnities
of this Order were perform’d at <i>Nostre Dame de
Maulins</i> in <i>Bourbonnois</i>, where he founded a College of
Twelve Canons, in Honour of the blessed Virgin; the
Intent was, to corroborate his Interest for the Aid of
the Duke of <i>Orleans</i>, against the Faction of the House of
<i>Burgundy</i>, and by joyning of Flowers <i>de Lys</i> and Thistles
(the Symbols of Hope and Courage) emblematically
to express the Nobleness of his Spirit against all
the Power of Fortune. He ordain’d the Number of
Knights to be Twenty Six, comprehending himself and
his Successors, Dukes of <i>Bourbon</i>, as Chiefs, and oblig’d
them to wear daily a Belt, a Girdle of Watchel coloured
Velvet, lin’d with Crimson Sattin embroider’d with
Gold, and therein the Word <i>Esperance</i> curiously
wrought. The Girdle was fasten’d with a Buckle and
Thong of Gold, bearded and chequer’d with Green,
enamel’d in Form like the Head of a Thistle. On the
Anniversary of the Festival (the Conception of our
Lady) the Knights wore Cassocks or Surcoats of Carnation
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>Damask with White Sleeves, girded as before;
the Mantle of the Order was sky-colour’d Damask with
broad Welts of Gold Embroidered on the Collar, and
lined with Red Satin, but the Mantlet of Green Velvet,
the Bonnet was also of Green Velvet; at the Point of
the Band hung a Tassel of Crimson Silk and Threads
Gold, the Lining of Crimson Taffaty, and turn’d up
after the antique manner, whereon they had embroided
the Golden Shield with the Word <i>Allen</i>; the
great Collar was of Gold, of the weight of Ten Marks,
enamelled with Green, distended like Network, which
was filled with Flowers <i>de Lys</i> (together with the Letters
of the Impress) plac’d in a Lozenge of Red Enamel;
at the Bottom of the Collar, in an Oval of Gold (the
Circle whereof was enamelled with Green and Red)
appeared the Figure of the Patroness, the Virgin <i>Mary</i>,
irradiated with Gold, and crowned with Twelve
Silver Stars, a Crescent of the same under her Feet,
enamell’d with Purple and Sky-colour; at the End of the
Oval depended the Head of a Thistle enamelled Green,
but bearded White. The Founder took an exact Patern
for the Order of the <i>Garter</i>, with which he acquainted
himself while he was Prisoner in <i>Windsor</i> Castle.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>25. <i>The Order of the</i> Dove</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Was</span> begun by <i>John</i> I. King of <i>Castile</i> in <i>Segovia</i>,
1390. or, as others, 1379. to encourage his Nobles to
prosecute the Noble Acts of his Grandfather King
<i>Henry</i> III. but the Founder dying the same Year, before
it had taken root, it became of small Continuance.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>26. <i>The Order of the</i> Argonauts <i>of St.</i> Nicholas</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Was</span> instituted by <i>Charles</i> III. King of <i>Naples</i>, 1382.
to preserve Amity among the Nobles, to compose Enmities
and suppress Seditions. If any of these Knights,
upon a Variance, refused a Reconciliation, the Ensigns
were to be forfeited. Others say the Design was to
advance Navigation, to which their Ensign alludes, being
a Ship floating upon the Waters in the midst of a
Storm, having this Motto, <i>Non credo tempori</i>. In the
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>Convent of that sumptuous Church which St. <i>Nicholas</i>,
Bishop of <i>Smyrna</i>, erected, was the grand Feast held
on the Anniversary of that Saint. This King appointed
a White Habit for the Knights, and prescribed them
laudable Constitutions; but for want of a settled Revenue,
their Splendor expired with their Founder.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>27. <i>Knights of St.</i> Anthony <i>in</i> Hainault.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Albert</span> of <i>Bavaria</i>, Earl of <i>Hainault</i>, <i>Holland</i>, and
<i>Zeland</i>, designing an Expedition against the <i>Turks</i> and
<i>Moors</i>, instituted this Order, 1382. The Ensign thereof
was a Golden Collar wrought after the Fashion of
an Hermit’s Girdle, at which hung a Walking-Staff, and
a little Golden Ball.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>28. <i>The</i> Porcupine <i>in</i> France,</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Was</span> erected by <i>Lewis</i> of <i>France</i>, Duke of <i>Orleans</i>,
1393. to honour the Solemnization of the Baptism of his
eldest Son <i>Charles</i>, by his Wife Daughter to the Duke of
<i>Milain</i>. He chose the Porcupine for his Devise, with
this Epigraph, <i>Cominus &amp; Eminus</i>; not only out of the
aspiring Hopes conceived of this Child, but also to intimate
something of Revenge against <i>John</i> Duke of
<i>Burgundy</i>, his mortal Enemy; the Porcupine being an
Emblem both Offensive and Defensive. Others make
<i>Charles</i> aforesaid the Founder of this Order, 1430. in
Imitation or Emulation of the Golden Fleece, instituted
by <i>Philip</i> Duke of <i>Burgundy</i>. Their Number, including
the Founder, was Twenty Five; their Habit,
Surcoats of Violet Velvet, and over them Mantles of
Watchet Velvet lin’d with Carnation Satin; the Collar
was formed of Gold Chains, at the End whereof hung
a Porcupine of Gold upon an enamelled Hillock of
Grass and Flowers, which Creature was also embroidered
on the Knights Belts.</p>

  <span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>
<h3 class='c010'>29. <i>The Order of the</i> Lily <i>or</i> Lilies <i>in</i> Arragon <i>or</i> de la Jarra<br /> de S. Maria, <i>of the Vessel of St.</i> Mary,</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Was</span> erected by <i>Ferdinand</i> King of that Country,
called the infant of <i>Antiquera</i>, 1403. and dedicated to
the Blessed Virgin. <i>Favin</i> ranges it under the Denomination
of the Title of the <i>Looking-glass of the Blessed
Virgin in</i> Castile, instituted in Memory of a Victory
King <i>Ferdinand</i> obtained in that Kingdom against the
<i>Moors</i>, 1410. whence he transplanted them with him
into <i>Arragon</i>, 1413. when he received the Crown,
where it flourished under the Sons of that King, and
then the Line was extinct.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>30. <i>The Order of the</i> Dragon overthrown <i>in</i> Hungary,</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Was</span> instituted, <i>A. D.</i> 1413. by the Emperor <i>Sigismond
the Glorious</i>, 1418. for the Defence of the Christian
Religion, and to crush or oppugn all Hereticks and
Schismaticks, and for the Satisfaction he receiv’d in
conferring Peace to the Churches of <i>Hungary</i> and <i>Bohemia</i>,
by the Aid of the Council of <i>Constance</i>. It was in
high esteem shortly after in <i>Germany</i>; but the Order and
Founder had very near the same Period. The Knights
wore daily, as their Ensign, a <i>Green Cross flory</i>, on solemn
Days, a Scarlet Cloak, and on the Mantlet of
Green Silk a double Chain of Gold (others say a Green
Ribbon) at the End of which hung a Dragon dead with
broken Wings, in posture of being overcome (the Symbol
of Heresy) enamelled with Variety of Colours.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>31. <i>The</i> Equites Tusini <i>in</i> Bohemia, <i>or else both in</i> <br />Bohemia <i>and</i> Austria.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>This</span> Order had its Name from <i>Toca</i>, a Cap or Coif.
The Archdukes of <i>Austria</i> were its Founders; which
they enacted to engage their Subjects in Defence of the
Christian Faith against <i>Turks</i> and <i>Hereticks</i>, conferring
upon the Knights towards their Support whatsoever
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>they acquired in the Wars, which was a respite to themselves,
after almost Two Hundred Years Charges, and
Military Expence; indeed the Encouragement proved so
good a Bait, that they cleared their Provinces almost of
all <i>Turks</i> and <i>Schismaticks</i> that infested them. Their
Badge was a plain <i>Green Cross</i>, and their Habit Red.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>32. Ordo Disciplinarum,</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Was</span> instituted by the <i>Bohemian</i> Kings, or rather the
<i>Austrian</i>, to be a Curb upon the <i>Turks</i> and <i>Hereticks</i>, at
least to prescribe the Confines of the Kingdom. The
Collar of the Order had a White Eagle. These Knights
flourished in <i>Germany</i>, in the Reigns of <i>Sigismond</i> and
<i>Albert</i> Emperors.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>33. Orde de la Scama, <i>in</i> Castile,</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Was</span> instituted by <i>John</i> II. King of that Realm, about
the Year, 1420. to excite his Nobility to fight against
the <i>Moors</i>, which produced so good Effect, that
in a short time the <i>Moors</i> were shamefully overthrown.
That King granted them Privileges, gave them their
Statutes and Rules; but upon his Death the Splendor
hereof was greatly eclips’d. Their Ensign was a Cross
composed of the Scales of Fishes. They were obliged
to defend <i>Castile</i> against the <i>Moors</i>, to dye in Defence of
the Faith, and when the King went to War they marched
before him. Their Ensign was a Cross composed of
the Scales of Fishes, the <i>Spanish Scama</i> bearing the same
Signification as the <i>Latin Squama</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>34. <i>The Order of the</i> Golden Fleece,</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Had</span> its Original from <i>Philip</i> II. Duke of <i>Burgundy</i>,
Sirnam’d <i>the Good</i>, the 10th of <i>Jan.</i> 1429. at his Marriage
with <i>Elizabeth</i>, Daughter of <i>Portugal</i>, in the City
of <i>Bruges</i> in <i>Flanders</i>, to perpetuate the Memory of his
great Revenues raised by Wools with the <i>Low-Countries</i>.
Some say in Commemoration of <i>Gideon</i>, who with
Three Hundred Men vanquished a numerous Army of the
<i>Midianites</i>; or of <i>Jacob</i>’s <i>Fleece</i>, viz. the Party-coloured
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>and streaked Fleece, after the Example of <i>Jason</i> and
his <i>Argonauts</i>, whose Expedition to <i>Colchos</i> he intended
to make his Patern by a Voyage into <i>Syria</i> against the
<i>Turks</i>. He founded it to the Glory of the Almighty
Creator, and Redeemer, in Reverence of the Virgin
<i>Mary</i>, and St. <i>Andrew</i> the Apostle, who was Patron
thereof, and whose Festival was celebrated on that Day,
but afterwards translated to the 1st of <i>May</i>, by reason
of the shortness of the Days, and the Fatigue aged
Knights would find to convene in an intemperate Season.
The Knights at first were Twenty Four, beside the
Duke, chief and supream, who reserved the Nomination
of Six more at the next Chapter; but <i>Charles</i> V.
encreased them, 1516. to Fifty. Duke <i>Charles</i> and
<i>Maximilian</i>, Sons to the Founder, annex’d many Privileges
to them, which were confirmed, 1556. For their
Habit Three different Mantles were ordain’d them at the
grand Solemnity; the first Day, of Scarlet Cloth,
richly embroidered about the Lower End, with Flints
struck into Sparks of Fire and Fleeces, with Chaperons
of the same; and the same Day, after Dinner, to proceed
to Vespers in Mantles of Black, and of the Colour of
Chaperons; the Day following they were to hear Mass
habited as themselves thought fit; but Duke <i>Charles</i>
aforesaid prescribed them Mantles of White Damask for
that Day’s Ceremony, and changed their Cloth Mantles
into Velvet. The great Collar is composed of double
Fusils, placed Back to Back, Two and Two together,
in form of the Letter B, representing it both Ways, to
signify <i>Bourgoigne</i>. And these Fusils are interwoven with
Flint-stones (in reference to the Arms of the ancient
Kings of <i>Bourgoigne</i>) seeming to strike Fire, and Sparkles
of Fire between them, the Device of the Founder, at
the End whereof hung the Resemblance of a Golden
Fleece, enamelled proper. To the Flint <i>Paradine</i>
ascribes the Motto, <i>Ante ferit quam Flamma micet</i>; and
to the Fleece, <i>Pretium non vile laboris</i>. The Jewel is
commonly worn in a double Chainet or Males of Gold,
linked together at convenient Distance, between which
runs a small Red Ribbon, or otherwise it is worn in a
Red Ribbon alone. The Emperors of <i>Germany</i> descended
from <i>Philip</i> Archduke of <i>Austria</i>, Duke of
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span><i>Burgundy</i> and Count of <i>Flanders</i>, were the Sovereigns of
it, till <i>Charles</i> V. gave the Guardianship of it to the
Kings of <i>Spain</i>, which he perform’d on the 25th of <i>October</i>,
1556. conferring it on his Son King <i>Philip</i> at <i>Bruxelles</i>,
when he took the Collar from his Neck, and with
his own Hands put it over his Son’s Shoulders in the
Presence of divers of the Knights, with this Form,
<i>Accipe, fili mi, quem e collo meo detraho, tibi præcipuum Aurei
velleris torquem, quem Philippus Dux Burgundiæ cognomine
bonus Atavus noster, monumentum Fidei Sacræ Romanæ Ecclesiæ,
esse voluit &amp; hujusce Institutionis ac Legum ejus, fac
semper memineris</i>: Since which the Honour of being
Chief of this Order remains at this Day in that
Crown.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>35. <i>The Order of St.</i> George <i>at</i> Genoa,</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Was</span> given by <i>Frederick</i> III. Emperor of <i>Germany</i>, in
honour of St. <i>George</i> the titular Saint and Patron of <i>Genoa</i>.
The Ensign is a plain Cross <i>Gules</i>, and worn by
the Knights at a Chain of Gold about their Neck. The
Dukes of <i>Genoa</i> are Chiefs thereof; and in regard their
Dignity lasts but two Years, the Order is much impair’d
thro the Inconstancy and Alteration of the
Times.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>36. <i>The Order of the</i> Croissant, <i>or</i> Half-Moon <i>in</i> France,</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Was</span> erected in the City of <i>Anjou</i>, 1464. or according
to the <i>Saincte Marthes</i>, <i>A. D.</i> 1448. by <i>Rene</i> of the
House of <i>Anjou</i>, King of <i>Jerusalem</i> and <i>Sicily</i>, &amp;c. Duke
of <i>Anjou</i>, &amp;c. The Intent thereof was the Honour of
God, Support of the Church, and Exaltation of Knighthood;
over which he declared himself and his Successors,
Dukes of <i>Anjou</i> and Kings of <i>Sicily</i>, Chiefs. He
also chose St. <i>Maurice</i>, Knight and Martyr, for Patron,
and held the first Ceremonies in the Church of <i>Angiers</i>
dedicated to his Name. The Symbol which the Knights
wore on the right Side of their Mantle, was a Golden
Crescent, whereon in Red Enamel was this Word <i>L’oz</i>,
signifying <i>L’oz en Croissant</i>, whereby they were spur’d
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>forwards to search after the Increase of Valour and Reputation.
At this <i>Crescent</i> was fasten’d as many small
Pieces of Gold, fashion’d like Columns, and enamell’d
with Red, as the Knights had been engag’d in Battels
and Sieges; for none could be adopted into this Order,
unless he had well trod the Paths of Honour. The
Knights were Thirty Six, others say Fifty, in Number.
For their Habit they wore Mantles of Red or Crimson
Velvet, and a Mantlet of White, with the Lining and
Surcoat of the same.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>37. <i>The Order of the</i> Ermin <i>in</i> Britanny,</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Was</span> erected by <i>Francis</i> I. Duke of <i>Bretagne</i>, to perpetuate
the Memory of his Grand-father <i>John</i> the
Conqueror, or else in Imitation of other Orders in
<i>France</i>; and thereupon he new built his Castle of <i>Ermin</i>.
The Number of these Knights were Twenty Five.
Their Habits were Mantles of White Damask lin’d
with Carnation, and the Mantlet of the same. The
great Collar was of Gold, compos’d of Ears of Corn
in <i>Saltire</i>, bound above and beneath with Two Circles
of Gold, imitating the Crown of <i>Ceres</i>, denoting the
Care of Husbandry, and was sometimes called <i>The Order
of the Ears of Corn</i>. At the End of this Collar hung
the <i>Mus Ponticus</i>, or Ermin, passing over a Turf of
Grass diaper’d with Flowers, at the Edge whereof was
imboss’d this Epigraph in <i>French</i>, <i>Amaire</i>, the Device
of his said Grand-father, by which he made known his
Courage; and rather than fail in the least Punctilio of
his Word, he would undergo any Misfortune. This
Order ended when the Dukedom of <i>Bretagne</i> became
annex’d to the Crown of <i>France</i>, by the Marriage of
<i>Anne</i>, Dutchess of <i>Bretagne</i>, to <i>Charles</i> VIII. and <i>Lewis</i>
XII. both <i>French</i> Kings.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>38. <i>The Order of the</i> Ermin <i>in</i> Naples</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Owes</span> its Institution to <i>Ferdinand</i> I. King of <i>Naples</i>,
at the Expiration of the War which he was engag’d in
with <i>John</i> of <i>Lorain</i>, Duke of <i>Calabria</i>, 1463. being induc’d
thereto by the Treason and Confederacy of his
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>Brother-in-law <i>Marinus Marcianus</i>, Duke of <i>Sessa</i>, who
design’d to murder him, and transfer the Kingdom to
the Duke of <i>Calabria</i>: But the Plot being defeated, instead
of bringing him to Justice, he not only pardon’d
him, but instituted this Chevalry, admitting therein
all the Noblemen of Title and Figure in the Kingdom,
and generously appointed him one of the first Knights.
The Collar was of Gold, intermix’d with Mud or Dirt,
to which depended an Ermin and this Motto, <i>Malo
mori quam fœdari</i>, alluding to the clean Nature of the
Animal.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>39. <i>The Order of St.</i> Michael <i>in</i> Naples,</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Had</span> its Original from the same King <i>Ferdinand</i>, in
honour of St. <i>Michael</i> the Arch-Angel, Patron of <i>Apulia</i>.
The Habit of the Knights was a long White Mantle
embroider’d with Ermins, and the Collar of Gold
compos’d of the Letter O, to which hung in an Oval
the Epigraph <i>Decorum</i>. By the Habit it seems to be
the preceding Order, if that was dedicated to St. <i>Michael</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>40. <i>The Order of St.</i> Michael <i>in</i> France.</h3>

<p class='c011'><i>Lewis</i> XI. King of that Realm, considering how his
Affairs were entangled, to re-unite the Affections of
his Nobility to himself, instituted these Knights, 1469.
giving them their Denomination from St. <i>Michael</i> the
Arch-Angel, the titular Angel and Protector of <i>France</i>,
in Reverence of whom their ancient Kings were wont
to solemnize this Feast-day with great Magnificence,
and keep an open Court. Their Number at first were
to be Thirty Six, whereof the King and his Successors
were Chief: But it afterwards proceeded to Three Hundred.
The Collar is compos’d of Escallop-Shells of
Gold, joyn’d one with another and double-banded, fasten’d
on small Chains of Gold, at the End of which
is annex’d an Oval of the same; and therein, on an
Hillock, is the Figure of St. <i>Michael</i> combating and
trampling down the Dragon. The Motto, <i>Immensi tremor
Oceani</i>. The Habit was a Mantle of White Damask
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>hanging down to the Ground, furr’d with Ermin,
having its Cope embroider’d with Gold, and the
Border of the Robe interwoven with Escallops of
Gold; the <i>Chaperon</i> or Hood, with its long Tippet, was
made of Crimson Velvet; but afterwards King <i>Henry</i> II.
order’d this Mantle to be Cloth of Silver, embroider’d
with Three <i>Crescents</i> of Silver, interwoven with Trophies,
Quivers and <i>Turkish</i> Bows, <i>semied</i> and <i>canton’d</i>
with Tongues and Flames of Fire; the <i>Chaperons</i> of
Crimson Velvet should have the same Embroidery. Their
Grand Festival was to be celebrated on <i>Michaelmas-day</i>,
at the Church of <i>Mount Michael</i> in <i>Normandy</i>; but after
wards transferr’d to <i>Bois de Vincennes</i> near <i>Paris</i>. There is
an Herald of Arms to attend this Order, called <i>Monsieur
St.</i> Michael. Upon the instituting <i>The Order of the Holy
Ghost</i>, not only Care was taken to preserve this of St.
<i>Michael</i>, and to rectify it, but the Knights had the Privilege
allow’d them, that if they thought fit they were
made capable of receiving that of <i>The Holy Ghost</i>, which
no Stranger or Native could be enroll’d in that had
taken upon him any other Order. The Collar of St.
<i>Michael</i> may be worn with that of <i>The Holy Ghost</i>, and
it is now frequently us’d. The Evening before any receive
<i>The Order of the Holy Ghost</i>, he is admitted into <i>The
Order of St.</i> Michael.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>41. <i>The Order of the</i> Elephant <i>in</i> Denmark.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>King</span> <i>Christian</i> I. being at <i>Rome</i> upon a religious Account,
Pope <i>Sixtus</i> IV. among other Honours, invested
him with this Order, in Memory of the Passion of our
Saviour; and withal ordain’d the Supreme or Chief in
his Successors, Kings of <i>Denmark</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>This</span> King founded the magnificent Chapel of the
Three Kings in the Cathedral Church of <i>Roschilt</i>, (Four
Leagues from <i>Copenhagen</i>) where the Knights were to
assemble upon the Death of any of their Fraternity. He
admitted thereunto divers Kings, Princes and Noblemen.
Its chief Ensign was the Figure of an Elephant,
on whose side (within a Rundle) was a Crown of
Thorns, with Three Nails all bloody, in Memory of
the Passion. The Knights were oblig’d to Acts of Piety,
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>Alms-Deeds, and certain Ceremonies, especially upon
those Days on which they wore the Ensigns. King
<i>John</i> valu’d it so highly, that he wore them on every
solemn Festival. He advanc’d it to that Pitch of Grandeur,
that our King <i>Henry</i> VIII. and <i>James</i> V. King of
<i>Scotland</i>, accepted it.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Hertholm</i>, a learned <i>Dane</i>, in a particular Treatise of
this <i>Elephantine Order</i>, says, The Badge was meerly Military,
anciently given as a Memorial and Incitement to
the <i>Danish</i> Princes, who took upon them the Defence
of Christianity against the <i>Moors</i> and <i>Africans</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Heretofore</span> the Knights wore a Collar of Gold compos’d
of castellated Elephants and Crosses, something
like the <i>Crosses ancrees</i> (<i>Menenius</i> calls them Spurs) at
which hung the Picture of the Virgin <i>Mary</i> to the Middle,
holding Christ in her Arms, and surrounded with
a Glory of Sun-beams. But that long since laid aside,
they now wear only a Blue Ribbon, at which hangs an
Elephant enamell’d White, adorn’d with Five large Diamonds
set in the Middle. These Elephants, in the
Reign of King <i>Christian</i> IV. had in the same Place, within
a Circle, the Letter C, and in the Center of it the
Figure 4, denoting <i>Christianus Quartus</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>This</span> Honour is usually conferr’d on the Days of
the King’s Coronation. <i>Frederick</i> III. brought into use,
in Imitation of <i>The Garter</i>, an embroider’d Glory of Silver
Purple wrought upon the left Side of their Cloak
or Vest, on which was embroider’d Two Crowns within
a Rundle, bearing this Motto, <i>Deus providebit</i>. The
late King, his Son, chang’d the Motto to, <i>Pietate &amp;
Justitia</i>; but all the Knights created by his Father are
oblig’d to continue the former Motto.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>42. <i>The Order of the</i> Burgundian Cross <i>at</i> Tunis,</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Was</span> instituted on St. <i>Mary Magdalen</i>’s Day, 1535. by
<i>Charles</i> V. Emperor of <i>Germany</i> and King of <i>Spain</i>, after
he had restor’d <i>Mulleasses</i>, King of <i>Tunis</i>, to his Kingdom,
to reward those Commanders who had behav’d
themselves well in the Victory. It was the Day wherein
he made his pompous Entry into <i>Tunis</i>, when clad in
the Coat he usually wore in Battle, whereon was embroider’d
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>a <i>Burgundian Cross</i>, which Cross he made the
Badge, and added a Steel striking Sparks of Fire out
of a Flint, with this Inscription, <i>Barbaria</i>; and for a
more ornamental Decoration, gave a Collar of Gold,
whereat hung this Badge.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>43. <i>Knights of the</i> Holy Ghost,</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Were</span> instituted by the <i>French</i> King, <i>Henry</i> III. 1578.
to unite his Nobles more firmly in their Obedience, to
encourage them to persevere in the <i>Romish</i> Religion, and
to illustrate the State of his Nobility. It was so call’d
by reason he was born on <i>Whitsunday</i>, 1550. elected that
Day, 1573. King of <i>Poland</i>; and on that Day, 1574.
came to the Crown of <i>France</i>. It was to consist of One
Hundred Knights, besides the Sovereign or Great Master,
which Office is inseparable from the Crown of
<i>France</i>. A long Mantle of Black Velvet turn’d up on
the left Side, and open’d on the right, was also appointed
for the Habit, being at first embroider’d round
with Gold and Silver, consisting of Flowers <i>de Lys</i> and
Knots of Gold, between Three sundry Cyphers of Silver;
and above the Flowers <i>de Lys</i> and Knots, were
thickly powder’d Flames of Fire. This great Mantle
was garnish’d with a Mantle of Cloth of Silver, cover’d
with Embroidery made after the same Fashion, excepting
only, that instead of Cyphers there were wrought
Doves of Silver, and both these Robes double lin’d
with a Satin of Orange-Tawney. The great Collar
worn over the Mantle, was at first compos’d of Flowers
<i>de Lys</i>, canton’d or corner’d with Flames of Fire, interwoven
with Three Cyphers and divers Monograms of
Silver; one was the Letter <i>H</i> and a <i>Greek Lambda</i>, both
double, for the King’s Name and the Queen’s, <i>Lovisa
de Lorain</i>; the other Two were reserv’d in the King’s
own Mind. But these Cyphers were taken off the
Colour and the Embroidery of the Robes by King
<i>Henry</i> IV. and for a Mark of his Victories, Trophies of
Arms were interlac’d instead thereof, with the Letter
<i>H</i> crown’d (the Initial of his Name) whereout arose
Flames and Sparks of Fire; and for the like Reason
the <i>H</i> has been chang’d into <i>L</i>, both by <i>Lewis</i> XIII and
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>XIV. At this Collar hung a Cross richly enamell’d in
the midst, whereon was figur’d a Dove in a flying Posture,
as descending down from Heaven with full
spread Wings: And that an Epigraph might not be
wanting, some have attributed to it this, <i>Duce &amp; Auspice</i>.
Besides these Ornaments, the Knights wear a
Black Velvet Cap, with a White Plume; their Breeches
and Doublets are of Cloth of Silver, and their Shoes
White ty’d with Roses or Knots of Black Velvet. The
Badges ordain’d to be ordinarily worn, are a Cross of
Yellow or Orange-colour Velvet, like a <i>Malta</i> Cross,
fix’d on the left Side of their Breast, except in military
Expeditions, and then they are permitted to wear them
of Cloth of Silver or White Velvet, having a Silver
Dove, and at the Angles or Corners, Rays and Flowers
<i>de Lys</i> of Silver. They have a Cross of the Order
made of Gold (like the <i>Malta</i> Cross) with a Flower
<i>de Lys</i> in each Angle, to be worn about their Necks in
a Blue Ribbon, and to be enamell’d White about the
Sides, but not in the Middle. Such as are Knights
both of St. <i>Michael</i> and <i>The Holy Ghost</i>, are to bear the
Figure of St. <i>Michael</i> on one Side, and of a Dove on the
other. The Anniversary is held on the first Day of the
New-Year, but the first Part of the Ceremony begins
always on the last Day of the Old, when it was instituted;
and the Place for celebrating thereof is the
Church of <i>Augustin</i> Fryars in <i>Paris</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>44. <i>The Order of</i> The precious Blood of our Saviour <br />Jesus Christ <i>of</i> Mantua,</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Was</span> instituted, 1608. by <i>Vincentio de Gonzago</i> IV.
Duke of <i>Mantua</i>, and II. of <i>Montferat</i>, for Defence and
Propagation of Christianity, and in Honour of Three
Drops of Blood of our Redeemer; as also to set forth
more nobly the Nuptials of his eldest Son <i>Francisco</i>. It
was confirm’d by Pope <i>Paul</i> V. and consisted of Twenty
Knights, the Founder and his Successors to be Great
Masters. The Collar is compos’d of Ovals of Gold,
some extended in Length, others in Breadth, alternately,
and interlink’d with small Anulets: Those in
Length have these Words rais’d in White Enamel, <i>Domine
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>probasti</i>; on the other in Breadth is a Grey Crucible
fill’d with small Rods of Gold, and placed on a
Trevet of Black Enamel over Flames of Fire, intimating,
that they who incorporated in this Society, should
hold inviolable Faith and Concord in the greatest Trials
and Emergences of Life; at the End of the Collar
is <i>pendant</i> a larger Oval of Gold, in which are figur’d
two Angels standing upright, holding between them a
Chalice crown’d, in the Table whereof are painted
Three Drops of Bloods enamell’d Red, and round the
Oval, <i>Nihil isto triste recepto</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>45. <i>The Order of the</i> Amaranta,</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Owes</span> its Institution to <i>Christina</i>, Queen of <i>Sweden</i>,
about the Year 1645. in honour of a Lady of that
Name, of great Beauty, Courage, Modesty and Charity.
The chief Ensign is a Jewel of Gold compos’d of Two
<i>A</i>’s, adorn’d with Diamonds on both Sides, and join’d
together by reversing one of them, being set within a
Circle of Laurel Leaves wreath’d about with White,
and on the Four Sides this Motto, <i>Dolcenella memoria</i>;
which Jewel the Knights wear either in a Gold Chain,
or a Crimson or Blue Ribbon, as they best like of. His
Investiture is with this Ceremony: The Queen being
seated under her State, an intended Knight kneels before
her, when she acquaints him with her Inducements
to confer on him this Honour, enumerating his Services
and Merits: This done, he takes an Oath, still
kneeling and holding his Hands between the Queen’s,
to defend her Person from Harm, and the Persons of
his Brother Knights; to incite Justice, Vertue and Piety,
and discountenance its Opposers; after which the
Queen puts about him (in the manner of a Baudrick)
a Crimson Silk Scarf with the Jewel fasten’d thereto.
To an absent Prince or Personage, she sends the Jewel,
accompany’d with her Letter, which supplies the Place
of a personal Investiture. Among many others have
been several Kings and Princes. Sir <i>Bulstrode Whitlocke</i>
has been elected Knight of this Order.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>
<h3 class='c010'>46. <i>The Order of the</i> Black Eagle,</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Was</span> instituted by <i>Frederick</i> King of <i>Prussia</i>, and Elector
of <i>Brandenburgh</i>, soon after he had the Title of
King conferr’d upon him.</p>

<p class='c008'>§ 2. 1. In the <i>West-Indies</i>, <i>Montezuma</i>, King of <i>Mexico</i>,
set Knighthood in the highest Splendor, ordaining certain
military Orders, with several Badges and Ensigns.
The most honourable among the Knights were those
that carry’d the Crown of their Hair ty’d with a little
Red Ribbon, having a rich Plume of Feathers, from
which did hang Branches and Rolls of Feathers upon
their Shoulders. They carry’d as many Rolls as they
had done gallant Exploits in the Wars; and the King
himself and his Sons were of this Order; which <i>Purchas</i>
calls <i>Eagle Knights</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. <span class='sc'>There</span> was another Order, call’d <i>Of the Lyons and
Tygers</i>. These Knights being commonly the most valiant
in the Wars, always bore with them their Badges
and Armories.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. <span class='sc'>Other</span> Knights there were, as <i>The Grey Knights</i>,
not so much respected as the rest. They had their
Hair cut round about the Ears: They made War upon
their Enemies with Ensigns like other Knights, and
were only arm’d to the Girdle, while the most Honourable
were <i>Cap-a-Pee’d</i>. All Knights might carry
Gold and Silver, be array’d in rich Cotton, have the
use of painted and gilt Vessels, and wear Shoes; but
the common People only the earthen sort; neither
might they carry Shoes nor Attire themselves, but in
a gross Stuff. Every Order had their Lodging assign’d
them in the Palace, distinguish’d by their proper Ensigns:
The first was the Lodging of the Prince, the
second of <i>Eagles</i>, the third of <i>Lyons and Tygers</i>, and the
fourth of <i>Grey Knights</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Province of <i>Cinaloa</i> (near <i>New Mexico</i>) created
their Knights by giving a Bow, and setting them to encounter
a Lyon or some other wild Beast.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> <i>Inguas</i>, or Lords of <i>Peru</i>, dedicated their Children
to Honour, by adorning them with <i>Guarras</i> or
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>Ensigns. They pierced their Ears, whip’d them with Slings,
smeared their Faces with Blood, in order they should
be true Knights to the <i>Ingua</i>. Those of Royal Extraction,
before they received the Order of Knighthood
abstained Seven Days from all manner of Nutriment,
except a little raw Grain and Water, and after being
heartned and brisked up again, performed some Military
Exercises, also Racing, Wrestling, Leaping, Shooting,
Slinging, throwing the Dart and Lance, <i>&amp;c.</i> and enduring
to be beaten on the Hands and Legs with
Wands; these being as it were the Tests whether they
could endure the Hardships of War or no; for if they
did not sustain them manfully, they were denied
Knighthood. The Ceremonies being performed by
boaring an Hole in the Ears, putting on gallant Shoes,
and wearing of the Breeches, which before they were
restricted, adorning their Heads with Flowers, and having
the Privilege of an Herb that none but themselves
cou’d make use of, and lastly giving an Axe into their
Hands. <i>Menenius</i> calls these Knights <i>Oreiones</i>, from
the <i>Spanish Orejas</i>, flop or loll-eared, in the <i>Latin Auriculares</i>,
from the Leaf which they bore hanging in their
Ears, or because they only negotiated Affairs with the
Emperor, and had his Ear at all times.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> <i>Japan</i> there’s an Order of Knights called <i>Mengoras</i>,
part of whom are called <i>Bonzees</i>, living in Fraternities,
as our Religionists in <i>Europe</i>. Some of these have the
Charge of their Idols, and the Service relating to their
Temples, others follow the Wars. They profess Chastity
with such Severity, that no Woman is allow’d to
enter their Cities. They govern the Kingdoms they
conquer, and are so very opulent that some of them
possess 60000 Duckets <i>per Annum</i>; and have a publick
Armory well stored to make use of upon any Exigence,
which is maintain’d by a daily Contribution. Women
have been excluded their Share in this Way of Honour,
tho’ their Courage and Valour have equalized the
<i>Amazons</i> of old; the Example is of the noble Women
of <i>Tortosa</i> in <i>Spain</i>, or the <i>Femme</i> Cavaliers of the <i>Torchi</i>.
<i>Micheli</i> barely calls them <i>Chavalleros</i>, or rather <i>Chavalleras</i>,
seeing the <i>Latins</i> have had the Words, <i>Equitissæ &amp; Militissæ</i>,
to express, <i>Virago’s</i> and <i>Heroines</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span><span class='sc'>Don</span> <i>Raymond</i>, last Earl of <i>Barcelona</i>, having in the
Year 1149. reduced the City of <i>Tortosa</i> from the <i>Moors</i>,
on the Thirty First following they laid a fresh Siege to
it, in hopes to recover it. The Inhabitants were at
length reduced to great Streights; they desired Relief
of the Earl, but he not being in a Condition to answer
their Request, they had Thoughts of a Surrender;
which the Women to prevent put on the Apparel of the
Men, and by a resolute Salley forced the <i>Moors</i> to raise
the Siege. The Gallantry of the Action the Earl acknowledged
by granting them several Privileges, and
to perpetuate the Memory instituted this Order,
somewhat like a Military one, and none were to be admitted,
only those brave Women, and the Honour to derive
to their Descendants, and assigned them for a Badge
a Thing like a <i>Fryer’s Capouche</i>, sharp at the Top, after
the Form of a Torch, of a Crimson Colour, to be worn
upon their Head-Cloaths; that at all publick Meetings
the Women should have Precedence of the Men, and
should be exempted from all Taxes, and that all the
Apparels and Jewels left by their dead Husbands should
be theirs.</p>

<p class='c000'>A more general Ornament of Honour peculiar to the
Fair Sex is the <i>Cordon</i>, which some will have to be an
Order, or Equivalent thereunto. The Institution is
attributed to <i>Anne Britaigne</i>, Wife to <i>Charles</i> VIII. of
<i>France</i>, who instead of the Military Belt or Collar, bestowed
a Cordon or Lace on several Ladies, admonishing
them to live chastly and devoutly, always mindful of
the Cords and Bonds of our Saviour, and to engage
them to a greater Esteem of it, she surrounded her
Escutcheon of Arms with the like Cordon; from which
Example the Arms of unmarried Ladies and Gentlewomen
are usually adorn’d with them.</p>

  <h2 id='ch04' class='c005'>CAP. IV.<br /> <br /><i>Of the Castle, Chapel and College of</i> Windsor, <i>&amp;c.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c007'>Having dispatch’d the several Orders of Knighthood,
and trac’d them from their proper Fountains,
we come now to treat of the most Noble
Order of the <i>Garter</i>; an Order, that not only grants
Merit, and Honourable, and Valiant Exploits at Home,
but what Imperial Heads and Persons, fam’d for the Antiquity
of their Race, or Gallantry of Actions, have always
esteem’d a further Advancement to their Glory
therein to be enroll’d. For the better Explanation, it
will be necessary to begin with the Description of the
Castle, Chapel, and College of <i>Windsor</i>. The Place
claims no greater Antiquity than of the <i>Saxons</i>, named by
them <i>Windleshore</i>, and, as <i>Cambden</i> conjectures, had the
Denomination from the Winding of a Shore thereabouts,
as did <i>Wandsworth</i> in <i>Surry</i>, heretofore written <i>Windlesworth</i>.
The first authentick Notice is from the
Donation which King <i>Edward the Confessor</i> made
thereof to the Monks of <i>Westminster</i>, (as the Charter expresses
it) <i>For the Hope of eternal Reward, the Remission of
all his Sins, the Sins of his Father, Mother, and all his Ancestors,
to the Praise of Almighty</i>, &amp;c. he grants <i>Wyndleshore</i>,
with all its Appurtenances, as an Endowment
and perpetual Inheritance, to the Use of the <i>Monks</i> there,
and at <i>Westminster</i>, that served GOD. Those Monks enjoy’d
it not long, for King <i>William the Conqueror</i>, in the
first Year of his Reign, being greatly enamour’d with
the pleasant Situation and Commodiousness of the Place,
situate so near the <i>Thames</i>, and the Wood fit for Game,
invited <i>Eadwin</i>, the then Abbot, and the <i>Monks</i>, to accept
in Exchange for it, <i>Wokendune</i> in <i>Essex</i>, a Mansion
called <i>Ferings</i>, with all its Members and Hamlets, together
with Fourteen <i>Sokemen</i> and their Lands, and one
Freeholder, and Three Houses in <i>Colchester</i>, all in <i>Essex</i>,
since which it has remained in the Crown.</p>

<p class='c000'>The King being thus possess’d, forthwith built a
Castle upon the Hill, which, in <i>Doomsday Book</i>, contained
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>half an Hide of Land, and is there noted to be
Parcel of the Mannor of [<i>Clivore</i>] <i>Clure</i>. This Castle
King <i>Henry</i> I. rebuilt, and beautified with great Magnificence,
and, in the Tenth Year of his Reign, held his
<i>Whitsontide</i> there with great State and Splendor. Shortly
after, in a Charter of Peace between King <i>Stephen</i>
and Duke <i>Henry</i>, (King <i>Henry</i> II. afterwards) this Castle
was called <i>Mola de Windesor</i>, the Fortress of <i>Windesor</i>.
Within this Castle was King <i>Edward</i> III. born, (commonly
called <i>Edward</i> of <i>Windsor</i>) and was baptized in
the old Chapel; and so great was his Affection to that
Place, that he constituted it the Seat of the most noble
Order of the <i>Garter</i>; and to embellish it the more, he
founded the College of the Chapel of St. <i>George</i>, and
much enlarged, and beautified the Castle.</p>

<p class='c000'>For this Work he appointed several Surveyors, whom
he assigned to press Hewers of Stone, Carpenters, and
such other Artificers as were thought useful and necessary,
as also to provide Stone, Timber, and all other
Materials for them. <i>William de Wyckham</i> (who attained
to be Bishop of <i>Winchester</i>) was one of these Supervisors,
and had that Place conferr’d on him by Letters Patent,
<i>October</i> 30. <i>Ed.</i> III. And a Grant of the same Fee was
likewise allowed to <i>Robert de Bernham</i>, viz. One Shilling
a Day, while he was at <i>Windsor</i>, Two Shillings when
he went elsewhere about that Affair, and Three Shillings
<i>per</i> Week to his Clerk; afterwards he was chief Custos
and Surveyor of this Castle, of the Mannors of Old and
New <i>Windsor</i>, and of other Castles, Mannors, <i>&amp;c.</i> belonging
to the King, to provide Workmen, and look after
the Repairs, and in those Mannors to hold Leets and other
Courts, Pleas of Trespass and Misdemeanours.</p>

<p class='c000'>About the 34th of <i>Ed.</i> III. it is presumed the most considerable
Enlargement of the Castle was made, seeing
there was then great Store of the ablest Diggers and
Masons impress’d, by virtue of Writs directed to the several
Sheriffs, with Command under 100 <i>l.</i> Penalty to
send them to <i>Windsor</i> the <i>Sunday</i> after the Feast of
St. <i>George</i>, to work at the Kings Charge, from whence
they were not to depart without <i>Wyckham</i>’s License, Security
having been first taken by the Sheriffs, and returned
into <i>Chancery</i>. <i>London</i> found Forty; <i>Essex</i>, in
conjunction with <i>Hertford</i>, Forty; <i>Wilts</i>, <i>Leicester</i>, with
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span><i>Worcester</i>, <i>Cambridge</i>, with <i>Huntington</i> Forty, <i>Kent</i>,
<i>Gloucester</i>, <i>Somerset</i>, with <i>Devon</i>, and <i>Northampton</i>,
one with another, found also Forty a-piece. And because
divers of these Workmen, for Gain and Advantage,
clandestinely left <i>Windsor</i> to the Hindrance of the Work,
all Persons were forbid to employ or retain them under
Forfeiture of all they had, and likewise to arrest those
that withdrew themselves from the Work, and commit
them to <i>Newgate</i>. <i>A.</i> 36. <i>Ed.</i> III. many of them being
swept away by the Pestilence, the like Writs were
directed to other Sheriffs, under a Hundred Pound Penalty,
to send able Men; whereupon the Counties of
<i>York</i> sent Sixty, <i>Derby</i> Twenty Four, <i>Salop</i> Sixty, <i>Hereford</i>
Fifty, <i>Nottingham</i> Twenty Four, <i>Lancaster</i> Twenty
Four, and <i>Devon</i> Sixty. <i>A.</i> 37. <i>Ed.</i> III. The noble
Edifice was ready for Glazing, and of Twenty Four of
that Occupation impress’d for the King’s Service,
Twelve were to be employed at <i>Windsor</i>. In this Year
and the next a great Proficiency was made, and vast
Quantities of Stone were amassed, dug out of the
Quarries of <i>Wellesfor</i>, <i>Newel</i>, and <i>Carby</i>, and other Places.
From the 37th to the 43d, the Building of the Castle was
diligently pursued. We find no Addition to this august
Pile till his 48th Year, and after that Time nothing
more during his Reign, so that it is supposed this Famous
Piece for Magnificence and Strength was then
chiefly finished, <i>viz.</i> the Great Hall of St. <i>George</i>, the
Lodgings on the East and South side of the Upper Ward,
the Keep or Tower in the Middle Ward, the Chapel of
St. <i>George</i>, the Houses for the Custos and the Canons in
the Lower Ward, with the whole Circumference of the
Walls, their several Towers and Gates, as in the present
Posture they remain.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> succeeding Times King <i>Hen.</i> VII. added that stately
Fabrick adjoining to the King’s Lodgings, in the
Upper Ward. King <i>Hen.</i> VIII. re-edified the great Gate
at the Entrance into the Lower Ward. King <i>Edw.</i> VI.
began, and Queen <i>Mary</i> perfected the Conveying the
Water, from <i>Blackmore-Park</i> in <i>Wingfield</i> Parish, into a
Fountain of curious Workmanship erected in the Middle
Ward, which supplied all the Castle. Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>
made a Terrace Work on the North side of the
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>Castle; from whence there is a pleasant Prospect down
upon <i>Eaton-bridge</i>, the <i>Thames</i>, and the adjacent Country.
King <i>Charles</i> I. <i>A. D.</i> 1636. built the Gate at the
East end of the Terrace, which leads into the Park.
And lastly, King <i>Charles</i> II. greatly beautified and repair’d
the Fabrick, and furnish’d it with a curious Armory;
and, in fine, every Thing is so fitly disposed and
ordered, that they are worthy of the Notice of every
nice and curious Traveller.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Camden</span> elegantly describes its Situation in Prose in
this manner: <i>From an Hill</i> (says he) <i>that rises with a
gentle Ascent, it enjoyeth a most delightful Prospect round
about; foreright, in the Front, it overlooketh a Vale, lying
out far and wide, garnished with Corn Fields, flourishing with
Meadows, deck’d with Groves on either side, and watered with
the most mild and calm River</i> Thames. <i>Behind it arise
Hills every where, neither rough nor over high, attired, as it
were with Woods, and even dedicated, as one would say, by
Nature, to hunting Game.</i></p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>This Castle is under the Government of a Constable, so
call’d in the Reign of King <i>John</i>, and has bore that Denomination
ever since: The Office is of great Antiquity,
Honour and Power, but of small Revenue, for it is partly
Military and Civil; as Military he commands the Castle
and any Garrison placed therein, and is obliged to defend
it against all Enemies whatsoever; all the Prisoners
brought hither are committed to his Charge, and is
answerable for all that is in the Castle to the King, under
whom he is Commander, as a Civil Officer. He is
Judge of a Court of Record held there by Prescription,
for determining, by way of Common Law, all Pleas
between Party and Party, arising within the Precincts
of the Forest of <i>Windsor</i>, and Liberties thereof,
which compriseth many Towns; and all legal Processes
issue out in his Name. He is allowed a Deputy learned
in the Law, who is called the Steward of the Court of
Record, and is Keeper of the Constable’s Seal of Office.
This Officer supplies the Constable’s Place as a Judge of
the Court of <i>Common Pleas</i>, from whose Judgment the
Appeal is by Writ of Error returnable in the <i>King’s-Bench</i>,
or <i>Common Pleas</i> at <i>Westminster</i>. The Constable is
likewise Forester and Warden of the Forest of <i>Windsor</i>,
which is an 120 Miles in compass. He hath under
him one or more Lieutenants at his Pleasure, and may
imprison any Trespasser in Vert and Venison Convict,
having a Prison in the Castle for that Purpose, named
the <i>Coalhole</i>. He hath the Freedom of using the Sports
of the Forest, which is granted to no Person without
his or the King’s License, and signs all Warrants to kill
Deer, (except what the King signs) and is to fell Timber
and Wood.</p>

in <i>William the Conqueror</i>’s Reign was <i>Walter Fitz Other</i>,
from whom the Family of the Barons of <i>Windsor</i> are descended,
and the Earls of <i>Plimouth</i>, bearing the Surname
of <i>Windsor</i>, <i>Temp. Car.</i> II. Prince <i>Rupert</i> was
Constable.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>We</span> come next to the Chapel of St. <i>George</i>, which is
situate in the Lower Ward or Court of this Castle, and
so named by King <i>Edw.</i> III. shortly after he had founded
the College mention’d in the next Section; he having
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>pulled down the old Chapel erected there by
King <i>Henry</i> I. and dedicated to King <i>Edward the Confessor</i>,
to raise a more stately Structure in its stead; to bring
which Matter to Perfection, in the 24th Year of his
Reign, <i>John de Spoulee</i> had the Office of Master of the
Stone-Hewers, and had Power to provide Masons, and
other Artificers, to whose Care they were entrusted.
In <i>Anno</i> 25. <i>Ed.</i> I. <i>John de Dorchester</i>, Sub-Constable of
the Castle, was appointed to keep a Controul upon all
the Provisions bought for the Works of the Chapel, as
well as on the Payments, and all other Affairs relating
thereunto. To this Fabrick he erected several Houses
adjoining, for the Custos and Canons to reside in; and
afterwards King <i>Hen.</i> IV. gave them the void Place in
the Castle call’d the <i>Woodhall</i>, nigh the great Hall, for
building of Houses and Apartments for the Vicars,
Clerks, and Choristers, and the other Ministers, assigned
for the Service of the Chapel; but King <i>Edw.</i> IV. observing
the Walls and Foundation of the Chapel sapped
and consumed, and esteeming the Fabrick not stately or
spacious enough, designed another more noble and excellent
in its Room: In order to it <i>Richard Beauchamp</i>,
Bishop of <i>Salisbury</i>, was constituted Master and Surveyor
of the Work, who had Power from the King to remove
all Impediments, demolished divers of the Officiary
Houses, and other irregular Piles and decay’d Walls,
and dug up their Foundations, particularly those ancient
Buildings on the East side of the Chapel, which extended
unto the Walls on the North side of the Castle, where
the Towers, <i>viz.</i> <i>Clurey</i>’s Tower, and <i>Le Amenery</i>’s Tower,
and <i>Barney</i>’s Tower, were situated; as also on the South
side of the Chapel, unto the Belfry there, exclusively;
the Materials whereof he might bestow upon any Buildings
in the Castle, as he thought convenient. How
well the Bishop discharged this Office, appears from the
Preamble of his Patent, whereby that King conferred
on him the Chancellorship of the <i>Garter</i>, in which is set
forth, <i>That out of meer Love towards the Order, he had given
himself the Leisure daily to attend the Advancement and Progress
of this goodly Fabrick</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>From</span> this Erection of K. <i>Ed.</i> IV. arose the elegant and
beauteous Structure now standing, enlarged in Length
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>at least an Hundred Fathom (tho’ it did not arrive to its
Perfection until the Reign of King <i>Henry</i> VIII.) together
with the Dean and Canons Houses on the North side of
the Chapel, and those of the Petty Canons raised at the
West End, in form of a Fetter-lock (one of King <i>Edward</i>
the IVth’s Badges) and so vulgarly call’d. <i>Temp.
Henry</i> VII. Sir <i>Reginald Bray</i>, Knight of the <i>Garter</i>, became
a liberal Benefactor, finishing the Body of the
Chapel, and rearing the Middle Chapel on the South
thereof, which still retains his Name, and where his
Body lies interred, as is manifest by his Arms,
Badges, <i>&amp;c.</i> cut in Stone, and by his last Will. <i>Anno</i>
21. <i>Hen.</i> VII. <i>John Hylmer</i> and <i>William Vertue</i>, Free Masons,
undertook the Vaulting the Roof of the Choir (a
curious Piece of Architecture) for 700 <i>l.</i> and finish’d it
by <i>Christmas</i>, 1508. <i>Anno</i> 8 <i>Henry</i> VIII. the Rood Loft,
and Lanthorn, were erected, with the Contributions
raised by the Knights Companions. Near to the East
end of this Chapel, was a little Fabrick of Free-Stone,
raised by Cardinal <i>Wolsey</i>, call’d the <i>Tomb House</i>, in the
Middle whereof he designed to erect a Monument for
King <i>Henry</i> VIII. and had almost finished it before he
died; but this was demolished, 1646. by command of
the <i>Long Parliament</i>; and all the Copper Figures, exceedingly
enriched by Art, carry’d thence. This Place
King <i>Charles</i> I. intended to enlarge, for the Interment of
his own Royal Body, and those of his Successors; but
those villainous Times drawn on, they with much ado
afforded him but a mean obscure Place near the first
high Place in the Choir of this Chapel, in the same
Vault where the Bodies of King <i>Henry</i> VIII. and his last
Queen yet remain.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> this Chapel, besides many of the Knights Companions,
repose the Body of King <i>Hen.</i> VI. removed
from <i>Chertsey</i> Abbey in <i>Surrey</i>, deposited under the Uppermost
Arch at the South side of the Altar, without
any Monument or Inscription, and likewise that of
King <i>Edw.</i> IV. under a large Stone of Tuch, raised
within the opposite Arch, at the North side of the Altar,
but without Inscription, having on the outside of
his Grave a Range of Steel gilt, to inclose it from the
North Isles, cut excellent well in Church-work.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span><span class='sc'>Over</span> this Arch hung this King’s Coat of Mail, cover’d
over with Crimson Velvet, and thereon the Arms
of <i>England</i> and <i>France</i> quarter’d and richly embroider’d
with Pearl and Gold, interwoven with divers Rubies;
which Trophy had remain’d over his Monument ever
since his Interment, till plunder’d by Captain <i>Fogg</i>, 1642.
who at the same time sacrilegiously robb’d the Chapel
of all its Altar-Plate.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Within</span> this Chapel were several Chantries endow’d
with Lands and other Revenues, for Chaplains
and Priests to sing Masses for the Souls of their Founder’s
Kindred.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>William</i> of <i>Wickham</i>, Bishop of <i>Winchester</i>, in 3 <i>Hen.</i> IV.
gave Two Hundred Marks to the Dean and Chapter,
to buy Twenty Marks <i>per Annum</i> to maintain one
Chaplain.</p>

<p class='c000'>18 <i>Ed.</i> IV. The Feoffees of <i>Richard</i>, Duke of <i>Glocester</i>,
gave the Mannors of <i>Bentfieldbury</i> in <i>Essex</i>, <i>Knapton</i>
in <i>Norfolk</i>, and <i>Chetlesworth</i> in <i>Suffolk</i>, for a daily Mass.</p>

<p class='c000'>22 <i>Ed.</i> IV. Sir <i>Thomas St. Leger</i> founded a Chantry of
Two Priests, who were to officiate in the middle Chapel
on the North Side of the Church; and the said
King, by his Will, ordain’d Two Priests to serve at his
Tomb, with an Exhibition of Twenty Marks yearly
a-piece.</p>

<p class='c000'>9 <i>Hen.</i> VII. There was another Chantry Priest assign’d
for <i>Thomas Pasche</i> and <i>William Hermer</i>, &amp;c. who was to
perform his Office at the Altar on the North Side the
new Church.</p>

<p class='c000'>13 <i>Hen.</i> VII. <i>Margaret</i>, Countess of <i>Richmond</i>, founded
a Chantry for Four Chaplains, to celebrate Mass in the
East Part of the new Work of the Chapel.</p>

<p class='c000'>18 <i>Hen.</i> VII. <i>William</i>, Lord <i>Hastings</i>, founded a Chantry
for One Priest, on the North Side of the Choir,
about the middle whereof this Lord lies.</p>

<p class='c000'>21 <i>Hen.</i> VII. <i>Charles Somerset</i>, Lord <i>Herbert</i>, (afterwards
Earl of <i>Worcester</i>) left a Secular Priest for a daily
Mass, <i>&amp;c.</i> to be said in the South Chapel dedicated to
the Virgin <i>Mary</i>, where he lies interr’d. Both these
Lords have built Appartments adjoyning for their
Chantry Priests, now to be seen and distinguish’d by
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>their Arms, garter’d and cut in Stone over their several
Doors.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>To</span> these we shall add the Foundation of the new
Commons, erected over against the North Door of the
Body of St. <i>George</i>’s Chapel, by <i>James Denton</i> one of the
Canons, <i>Anno</i> 11 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. for the Lodging and Dieting
such of the Chantry Priests, Choristers and stipendiary
Priests, who had before no certain Place where to
hold Commons in, which he furnish’d with all proper
Utensils, the Charge amounting to 489 <i>l.</i> 7 <i>s.</i> 1 <i>d.</i> in
lieu of which the Choristers were to say certain Prayers
when they enter’d the Chapel, commemorate his Death,
and pray for his and the Souls of all the Faithful departed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> this Chapel of St. <i>George</i> there were heretofore
several Anniversaries or Obits held and celebrated,
which we pass over. And as it was usual for some of
the military Profession to spend the Remains of their
Lives in pious Speculations, for their King and Country,
and the Salvation of their own Souls, Permission
was allow’d to the well-dispos’d <i>Knights of the Garter</i>,
who retir’d from the Noise and Bustle of the World,
to make their Abode there; yet so as to maintain themselves
out of their own Revenues. King <i>Henry</i> VIII.
ordain’d that the Sovereign should assign them convenient
Appartments within the Castle; and the like Favour
he granted to other Knights, tho’ not of the Order;
but the Lodgings to be such as the Sovereign
and Knights Companions should decree: However, we
do not find the Knights Companions made use of the
Benefit, but only for their better Accommodation at
the grand Feast of the Order, <i>&amp;c.</i> A Motion was
made, 14 <i>Car.</i> I. that they might have Lodgings assign’d
them in the great Court, which they offer’d to repair at
their own Charge, since all the Officers had Conveniencies
in the Castle, but the Knights Companions none,
which the King did not dissent to, provided it be
without Exclusion of the great Officers of State.</p>

<p class='c000'>§ 3. <span class='sc'>Within</span> the Chapel of the Castle, erected by
King <i>Henry</i> I. was founded a College for Eight Canons,
to be maintain’d by an annual Pension out of the Exchequer.
King <i>Edw.</i> II. founded here a Chantry for
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>Four Chaplains and Two Clerks; as likewise a Chapel
in the Park of <i>Windsor</i>, under the same Regulation,
for Four more Chaplains, whom King <i>Edw.</i> III. remov’d
and joyn’d to those before settled in the Chapel
of the Castle, and built Habitations for their better
Accommodation, on the South Side thereof.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Foundation we treated of here was confirm’d
by Letters Patent, dated at <i>Westminster</i>, <i>Aug.</i> 6. 22 <i>Edw.</i>
III. three Quarters of a Year before he erected <i>The
Order of the Garter</i>, when he laid the Foundation of the
ancient Chapel a-fresh, in honour of God, the Virgin
<i>Mary</i>, St. <i>George</i> and St. <i>Edward the Confessor</i>; and ordain’d,
that to King <i>Henry</i>’s Eight Canons there should
be annex’d One Custos, Fifteen more Canons, and
Twenty Four Alms-Knights, together with other Ministers,
all under the Power of the Custos, and these
to be supported out of the Revenues wherewith this
Chapel should be endow’d: Upon which Pope <i>Clement</i>
VI. 1351. by his Bull directed to the Arch-bishop
of <i>Canterbury</i> and Bishop of <i>Winchester</i>, approved in
part the King’s Intention.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> next Year the Statutes and Ordinances of the
College commenc’d, by Virtue of the Pope’s Authority,
the King’s Command, and Consent of the Bishop of
<i>Salisbury</i>, in whose Diocess the Chapel is situate. By
which Statutes, <i>Winchester</i> (one of the Pope’s Delegates)
instituted a College, within the Precincts of the Chapel
of St. <i>George</i>, consisting of one Custos, Twelve Secular
Canons, Thirteen Priests or Vicars, Four Clerks,
Six Choristers, and Twenty Six Alms-Knights, besides
other Officers.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>DEAN.</h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 4. <span class='sc'>The</span> first Custos was <i>John de la Chambre</i>, constituted
Nov. 14. 22 <i>Edw.</i> III. to whom succeeded <i>William
Mugg</i>, on the 18th of June following: Which <i>Mugg</i> is
the first, if the Institution of the College bears Date
by Papal, and not Kingly Authority. After him were
others that were call’d by the same Title; till the last
Year of King <i>Henry</i> IV. when <i>Thomas Kingston</i> was presented
by the Name of Dean; and his Successor, <i>John
Arundel</i>, observing divers Endowments granted to the
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>College alternately, by the Name of Custos, Dean and
Custos, or lastly of Dean only; and doubting this
Variation of Titles in Time might bring Inconveniences
upon the Foundation, petition’d the Parliament,
8 <i>Hen.</i> VI. whereupon the King, by Letters Patent under
the Great Seal, granted that the said <i>John</i> should
be <i>Custos sive Decanus</i> for Life, and his Successors <i>Custodes
sive Decani</i>, Wardens or Deans of the Free Chapel of
St. <i>George</i>, within the Castle of <i>Windsor</i>; and that the
Custos, or Dean and Canons thereof, and their Successors,
by that Appellation, should have and hold, to
them and their Successors for ever, all Lands, Tenements,
<i>&amp;c.</i> Liberties, <i>&amp;c.</i> devolv’d upon the College
at any Time before: So that here was a kind of new
Incorporation, by the Title of Custos, or Deans and
Canons only; at least this was a great Step to compleat
the Privilege they after enjoy’d, when thro’ the
Interest of <i>Richard Beauchamp</i>, Bishop of <i>Salisbury</i>, then
also Dean of <i>Windsor</i>, and Chancellor of the Order,
King <i>Edw.</i> IV. by Letters Patent dated <i>Dec.</i> 6. in the
19th Year of his Reign, model’d them by the Name of
Dean and Canons of the Free Chapel of St. <i>George</i>
within the Castle of <i>Windsor</i>, one Body corporate in
Thing and Name, with a perpetual Succession, and capable
in Law to purchase, receive and take Lands, <i>&amp;c.</i>
in Fee and Perpetuity; to have a common Seal, and
might plead and be impleaded by that Name; and for
better Security, the Letters Patent of Incorporation
were, within Three Years after, pass’d into an Act of
Parliament now in force.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Authority of the Custos or Dean consists in
being President over the rest of the College; to govern,
direct and order them their Goods and Estates.
He has all manner of Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction over
them, with a Reservation of Power of Appeal to the
Chancellor of <i>England</i>, who is Visitor of that College.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>When</span> any Persons lead Lives inordinate, he with
the Chapter (in Cases where no particular Penalty is
appointed) may reprehend or correct at Discretion;
and in Matters of Discord, shall within Eight Days reconcile
the contending Parties, or do Justice. After
thrice Admonition, may expel from the College all
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>Sowers of Discord, Backbiters and Whisperers, that are
below the Degree of a Canon. And that there be no
defect of Government, when the Dean has Occasion to
be absent above Eight Days, he shall appoint One of
the Canon Residents for his Deputy, in whose absence
he has the Title of Lieutenant, and on all Occasions to
exercise his Office; for the Statutes allow him Sixty
Days in a Year for Non-residence; which space the
Royal Visitation, 1552. enlarg’d to One Hundred and
Ten Days; and the Lord Chancellor <i>Hyde</i> granted him
Liberty of Six Weeks absence. But in the Vacancy of
the Custos, the Chapter has all his Power conferr’d on
them; which Chapter ought, within Two Days after
the Vacancy made known, elect one of the Resident
Canons, under the Title of President, to govern the
College until they be provided of another Custos.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>CANONS.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>The</span> Canons, by the Letters Patent of the first Erection,
were appointed to be Twenty Four, including
the Custos; but upon the Institution of the College by
the Bishop of <i>Winton</i>, there was ordain’d, as afore-noted,
One Custos, Twelve Secular Canons, and Thirteen
Priests or Vicars, in all Twenty Six, compleatly
the Number of <i>The Knights of the Garter</i>: And for a fuller
Distinction between these Canons Secular and the
Priests, the first Twelve are, in a Bull of Pope <i>Innocent</i>
VIII. nam’d <i>Majores Canonici</i>, the others <i>Minores</i>, or
Petty-Canons. To these Twelve Seculars were assign’d
so many Prebendships in the Chapel of St. <i>George</i> (as
also Stalls in the Choir and Place in the Chapter) together
with that held by the Custos, whence they are
frequently styl’d Prebends, and have a sacerdotal Power;
for if they are not in full Orders before they are
instal’d, they must, within a Year after they have enjoy’d
their Prebendship, be ordain’d a Priest, or quit the
Benefice.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>By</span> the Bull of Pope <i>Clement</i> VI. the Right of presenting
the Canons, Priests, Clerks, Alms-Knights and
other Ministers, were reserv’d to the Founder and his
Successors; yet we find the first Canons were presented
to the Custos, by the Founders of <i>The Order of the Garter</i>
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span><i>viz.</i> the Twenty Five first Knights Companions,
every one presenting singularly; yet this was but with
the Sovereign’s Permission, <i>Pro hac vice</i>; and that none
of them should be entitled to it hereafter but the Sovereign
alone. And because it might the more effectually
be observ’d, the Custos was oblig’d upon every
Canon’s Death, to signify the same to the Sovereign,
that he might pitch on One to succeed; which being
nominated, he is approved, instituted, and instal’d, by
the Custos or Dean, to whom he swears Canonical Obedience,
and Observance of the Statutes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> principal Duty of these Canons (and of all the
other Ministers of the College) is continually to attend
upon the Service of God in the Chapel of St. <i>George</i>;
and the Statutes run upon each Day’s Omission of a
Canon Resident, to be mulcted his <i>quotidian</i> Distribution
12 <i>d.</i> And tho’ we find no License of Non-Residence
granted them by their Founder, yet there is
mention of Canons Resident and Non-Resident, for
whom great Defalcations are appointed to be made, to
prevent such Neglects, because the residentiary Canons
bear not only the Burden of that Duty belonging to the
Chapel, but the Expence of Hospitality and other
Works of Charity, occasion’d from their residing at
<i>Windsor</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Richard Beauchamp</i>, Bishop of <i>Salisbury</i>, obtain’d Power
from <i>Sextus</i> IV. to make new Statutes, and dispens’d
with the old Ones; and in 1478. he gave to the Dean
and every Canon Fourteen Days of Non-Residence in
every Term, to wit, Fifty Six Days in the Year. By
the Visitation, 1552. they obtain’d a Dispensation for
Eighty Days; and the Lord Chancellor <i>Hatton</i> yet gave
them a further Permission to Two Hundred and Two
Days, which the Lord Chancellor <i>Hyde</i> confirm’d; so
that there remains One Hundred and Sixty Three Days
in the Year, in which the Canons ought to be resident
with Hospitality, to be consonant to their Statutes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Canons are particularly oblig’d to pray for the
Sovereign, and for the happy Estate of the Order. If
any Knight Companion, or other Person, should bestow
Ten Pounds <i>per Annum</i>, in order to be Partaker
of the Prayers appointed for the Benefactors of the
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>College, his Name was to be inscribed amongst them,
and he also prayed for. Which Article, tho’ King <i>Hen.</i> V.
confirmed, yet with this Restriction, it should not be
admitted without the Consent of the Sovereign, or the
Knights-Companions of the Order. 4 <i>Edw.</i> VI. some
one of them were enjoyned to commemorate the Benefactors
in a Discourse upon the <i>Tuesday</i> next after the
third <i>Sunday</i> in <i>Lent</i>, and on the first <i>Tusedays</i> in <i>June</i>,
<i>September</i> and <i>December</i>, and not only to set forth the
Munificence of the Founder, and of King <i>Hen.</i> VIII. but
of all others, so as to excite their Auditors to an Emulation,
in the Increase of Religion, and setting forth of
God’s Glory.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> civil Obligations of these Canons are to attend
the Sovereign (or his Deputy) and the Knights Companions
at their grand Feast, and at the Feasts of the
Installation, or when the Sovereign or Knights Companions
shall come to the Chapel of St. <i>George</i> upon a Religious
Account. On those solemn Days, over their Ecclessastical
Habit they wear a Murrey Mantle, (at this
Day a Taffaty Robe, in Fashion like the three inferior
Officers of the Order) with the Arms of St. <i>George</i>
arched within a Rundle on the Right Shoulder.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>PETTY CANONS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Those now call’d Petty Canons in the Patent of Foundation
went undistinguish’d with the <i>Canones Majores</i>:
only in the Bull of Pope <i>Clement</i> VI. to the Archbishop
of <i>Canterbury</i> and Bishop of <i>Winton</i>, for instituting the
College, they are called <i>Presbyteri</i>; and by the said
Bishop in the very Words of his Statutes, <i>Presbyteri seu
Vicarii</i>, by which last Name they are styl’d at the first
Erection of the Garter. Their Number was originally
Thirteen, only King <i>Henry</i> the VIIIth’s <i>English</i> Statutes
mention Eight petty Canons, besides Thirteen
Vicars, (but the <i>Latin</i> takes Notice only of Thirteen
Priests, some called <i>Canonici Minores</i>, others <i>Vicarii</i>.)
<i>Ann.</i> 1. <i>Edw.</i> VI. Twelve Priests were appointed, and
named Petty Canons, that is, Four to be added to the
Eight mention’d in the Statute of King <i>Henry</i> VIII. Yet
in Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>’s Ordinances for the continual
Charge, the Petty Canons thereby provided for are
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>Thirteen, agreeable to the ancient Number of Vicars;
but at this Day they are reduced to Seven, and one of
them Subchanter.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Vicars at their Admission are bound to be Priests,
at least Deacons, and at the next Ordination they must
commence Priests. Their Statutes oblige them to continual
Residence; and if absent from Matins or from
the grand Mass, they are amerced 2 <i>d.</i> and for every
Canonical Hour, the Mass of the Virgin <i>Mary</i>, or for
the Defunct, a Penny: All which Forfeitures were to
be deducted out of their Sallary, and divided among
those Vicars that duly attend these Duties. But the
Statutes 1 <i>Edw.</i> VI. state the Forfeit of Absence from
Matins to be one Half-penny, and the like from Procession,
Communion or Even-Song, to be paid to the
Poor’s Box. And not only they, but all other Ministers
of the Chapel, if they leave the College above
Twenty Days, without Reasons sufficiently approved
of by the Residentiary Canons; or any of the Society
that lead a vicious or scandalous Life, after the Fact
manifestly proved before the <i>Custos</i>, are to be expelled;
but an Absence less than Twenty Days, without Leave
granted, is punishable at Discretion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Each Vicar enjoy’d at first an annual Pension of 8 <i>l.</i>
paid after this Manner, <i>viz.</i> every Kalendar Month
8 <i>s.</i> for their Diet, and at the Expiration of every
Quarter Day the Surplus was consign’d for other Necessaries
they stood in need of. King <i>Ed.</i> IV. encreased
their Pensions to Twenty Marks a-piece; to which
Queen <i>Elizabeth</i> (they being then called Petty Canons)
advanced 13 <i>s.</i> and 4 <i>d.</i> <i>per Annum</i> to each out of the
Lands confirm’d on the College by King <i>Ed.</i> VI. and
now their yearly Sallaries are encreas’d to Thirty
Pounds. Out of these Petty Canons is elected a Subchanter,
(and commonly the same Person is the Dean’s
Vicar) who has the Cure of Souls, marries and buries,
<i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<h3 class='c010'>CLERKS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>For the Service of the Choir at the Foundation were
allotted Four Clerks, one whereof was to be instituted
a Deacon, and another a Sub-deacon before their Admission,
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>and these two were design’d (upon Vacancy)
to the Vicars Places. But for the other Two, Institution
into lesser Orders, in which they were to continue,
were sufficient. Each of the Two first sort had
Eight Marks <i>per Ann.</i> and the other Two but Six. King
<i>Ed.</i> IV. encreas’d their Number to Thirteen, and allow’d
them 10 <i>l.</i> <i>per Ann.</i> They are mention’d to be
Thirteen in <i>Hen.</i> VIII’s Statutes. 1 <i>Ed.</i> VI. they were
encreas’d to Fifteen; but here appointed to be Laymen,
wearing Surplices in the Choir, each having the
same Allowance. 4 <i>Ed.</i> VI. a Model was proposed to
augment the Number of these Fifteen Clerks to Twenty.
But in the Reign of Queen <i>Elizabeth</i> they were
again reduced to Thirteen, as at this present they remain,
(one of them as Organist hath a double Clerk’s
Place, and consequently reckon’d for Two) and an
Augmentation to each of 2 <i>l.</i> 13 <i>s.</i> 4 <i>d.</i> three Farthings
yearly; which being at first opposed by the Dean and
Prebends, they at length (5 <i>Eliz.</i>) consented to allow
them 40 <i>s.</i> <i>per Ann.</i> a-piece, not out of the new Lands,
but out of other Payments which the Dean and Chapter
should otherwise receive; and 1662. they encreased
their annual Pensions to 23 <i>l.</i> a-piece. They are obliged
to be present in the Choir at Divine Service
as well as the Petty Canons, and under the same
Forfeitures; nor may they or the Petty Canons go out
of Town above Three at once, lest the Choir should be
left unprovided.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>CHOIRISTERS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>For the Service of the Choir were appointed Six
Choiristers, and they to be of the Clerical Order at
their Admission; to each of which was allow’d Five
Marks <i>per Ann.</i> And as the Deacon and Sub-deacon
were plac’d in the College only in Addition to the
Vicars, and design’d to succeed them in their Vacancies;
so also were there Six secular Children, endued
with clear tuneable Voices, to succeed the Choiristers,
when they perceiv’d a Roughness or Alteration in their
Voices. King <i>Ed.</i> IV. encreas’d the Number of Choiristers
to Thirteen, and allow’d them annually Six Marks
a-piece, and which was again confirm’d by King <i>H.</i> VIII’s
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>Statutes. Yet the Injunction of 1 <i>Ed.</i> VI. reduced them
to Ten; but Queen <i>Elizabeth</i> establish’d the former
Number, and gave in Augmentation among them all of
3 <i>l.</i> 11 <i>s.</i> 8 <i>d.</i> They are now reduced to Eight, and
their present Exhibition is 12 <i>s.</i> <i>per</i> Month.</p>

<p class='c008'>§. 5. The Alms Knights we shall treat of in a threefold
Estate: 1. Under the Foundation; 2. When disjointed
thence by Act of Parliament; and, 3. As established
anew by Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>1. <span class='sc'>Then</span>, King <i>Edward</i> III. out of the great Regard
he had to military Honour, and those who had bravely
behav’d themselves in his Wars, yet after chanced to
fall in decay, made a Provision for their Relief and comfortable
Subsistence in old Age, by providing for them
in this his Foundation, and making a Coalition in one
joint Body with the Custos and Canons; these he call’d
<i>Milites Pauperes</i>, and we Poor or Alms-Knights. The stated
Number at first were Twenty Four, equal to the Custos
and Canons at the first Erection. But shortly after, upon
his instituting the Order of the <i>Garter</i>, Two more
were added (as there was to the first Canons) to make
the compleat Number of the Knights-Companions of that
Order, which were Twenty Six, as we find stated at
the Ordination of the College by the Bishop of <i>Winchester</i>,
the Pope’s Delegate.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Intention of the Founder was for those that
were real Objects of Charity, as he describes them, <i>viz.</i>
poor Knights, infirm in Body, indigent and decay’d, or
as the Statutes of the <i>Garter</i> qualifies them, such as
thro’ adverse Turns of Fortune were reduced to that
Extremity that they had not wherewithal to sustain
themselves, to live so genteelly as was suitable for a
Military Condition, which for greater Caution was reiterated
in the Statutes of King <i>Hen.</i> V. King <i>Hen.</i> VIII.
and in the Orders of Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>; for it was express’d,
in case any Estate of 20 <i>l.</i> <i>per Annum</i> devolved
on them, such Knights were to be discharged the College,
and they were to proceed to a new Election.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>At</span> the first each Knight-Companion of the Order
presented his Alms-Knight, but ever after their Election
was to be at the Disposal of the Sovereign. Their Habit
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>was a Red Mantle, with the Escutcheon of St. <i>George</i>,
without any Garter to surround it. Their Exhibition,
after their first Election was 12 <i>d.</i> a-piece every Day
they were at Service in the Chapel, or resident in the
College, besides 40 <i>s.</i> <i>per Annum</i> for other Contingencies,
it being the stated Allowance appointed to each
of the Canons Residents.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>About</span> the Beginning of King <i>Hen.</i> VI’s Reign, their
<i>quotidian</i> Distributions and Annual 40 <i>s.</i> had been unpaid
upon the Account of some Dissentions risen between
them and the Dean and Canons; but upon Complaint
of <i>John</i> Bishop of <i>York</i>, Lord Chancellor of <i>England</i>,
and Visitor of the College, 10 <i>Hen.</i> VI. they were redressed,
and their Arrears of both discharged, without
any Deduction, and likewise obtained this Clause, That if
the Treasurer of the College became negligent in future
Payments, he should lose his own <i>Quotidians</i>, from
the Time of his voluntary Omission, and the same to
be divided among the Alms-Knights. Their Duty was
to pray for the Sovereign and the Knights Companions,
to be every Day present at High Mass, the Masses of the
Virgin <i>Mary</i>, at Vespers and Compline, and in default
to be mulcted their 12 <i>d.</i> <i>toties quoties</i>, which was to
be converted to the Use of the other Alms-Knights, then
residing in the Castle of <i>Windsor</i>; notwithstanding
which Decree, the Dean did afterwards break in upon
them, and disposed of these Forfeitures at his Pleasure,
till 2 <i>Rich.</i> II. <i>Adam</i>, Bishop of St. <i>David</i>’s, then
Chancellor of <i>England</i>, and Visitor of the College, redress’d
it, and another Complaint of like Nature being
made of the Deans disposing of Donations and other
Liberalities of the Knights Companions in wrong of the
Alms-Knights, this Chancellor decreed an equal Distribution
between the Alms-Knights and Canons, till
the King and Council should otherwise determine.</p>

<p class='c000'>These and other Differences between the Dean and
Canons and Alms Knights, grew up to that height, that
they became irreconcileable, insomuch as in the Act of
Parliament, 22 <i>Edw.</i> IV. for incorporating of the Custos
and Canons, by the Name of Dean and Canons,
the Alms-Knights were not only omitted; but this
Clause inserted, <i>That the Dean and Canons, and their Successors,
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>should for ever more be utterly quit and discharged
from all manner of Exhibition or Charge of or for any of the
said Knights</i>. And this under the Cover, That the King
has greatly augmented the Number of the Ministers of
the Chapel, that the Revenue was insufficient to maintain
both them and the Alms-Knights; but in the Dean
and Canons Answer to the Knights Petition to repeal
this Act, the Cause is alledged, For that some of these
Knights used their utmost Endeavours before this Act,
to incorporate themselves, and to be exempt from the
Obedience and Rule of the Dean and Canons.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>After</span> this Act, which struck off their Quotidian
Portions and Fees assigned by King <i>Edward</i>’s Foundation,
how the Alms Knights subsisted we find not; but
so soon as King <i>Hen.</i> VII. came to the Crown, they petitioned
the King and Parliament for Repeal of the Act,
22 <i>Edw.</i> IV. and alledged it was obtained without their
Knowledge, or being called thereunto, which Plea availed
not at all; but on the contrary, the Dean and
Canons, some Years after, got an Exemplification thereof
under the great Seal, dated <i>Feb.</i> 4. 18 <i>Hen.</i> VII.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>And</span> it is very evident from King <i>Hen.</i> VIII’s Letter to
the College, that what they did in this Nature after
this Act commenced, was merely upon Courtesie; for
he returns them Thanks for a Pension of Twenty Marks
conferred upon <i>Peter Narbone</i>, whom he had recommended
to an Alms-Knights Place, and Promises to
burthen them no more with Requests of this sort, but
that he would settle Lands for their Maintenance. So
great was their Caution, <i>Narbone</i> was by Covenants indented
between him and the Dean and Canons, to relinquish
his Pension upon that King’s settling Lands on
the College, for the Provision of such Knights. In the
Interval between the Disunion of the College and Alms-Knights,
to their Establishment by Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>,
their Habit and Badge continued the same, and was so
confirmed by <i>Hen.</i> VIII’s Statutes. It may be collected
by his last Will, there was an Intention to draw the
<i>Garter</i> about the Escutcheon of St. <i>George</i>, which Projection
came to nothing, and expired. In this Interval
it is observ’d that several Persons of considerable Rank
and Distinction became Alms-Knights; some of which
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>were rendred great Objects of Charity; among which
Number was Sir <i>Robert Champlayne</i>, a valiant Knight,
an Honour to our Nation, for his renowned and martial
Services abroad. He was of King <i>Henry</i> VI’s Party in
the Civil Wars against King <i>Edw.</i> IV. Immediately after
whose coming to the Crown he left <i>England</i>, and travelled
into <i>Hungary</i>, (with an Equipage of Three Servants
and Four Horses) where in the Assistance of <i>Mathous
Corvinius</i> King of <i>Hungary</i> against the <i>Turks</i>, he behaved
himself very gallantly; but prosperous Fortune not
always attending him with Success, he receiv’d many
Wounds; and at length was taken Prisoner, lost all,
and forced to pay 1500 Ducats for his Ransom; for the
Attestation of which he had the Great Seals of the King
of <i>Hungary</i>, the Archbishop of <i>Crete</i>, Legate <i>de Latere</i>
in <i>Hungary</i>, the Emperor of <i>Germany</i>, the King of <i>Sicily</i>,
the Count <i>Palatine</i> of the <i>Rhine</i>, and the Duke of <i>Burgundy</i>;
and lastly, a Declaration thereof under the Privy
Seal of King <i>Edw.</i> IV. And being reduced to so low an
Ebb of Fortune, he was, thro’ <i>Hen.</i> VII’s Favour, admitted
an Alms-Knight.</p>

<p class='c000'>But some obtained Admittance, probably out of Devotion,
rather than Poverty, as <i>Thomas Hulme</i>, <i>Clarenceux</i>
King of Arms, <i>Temp. Edw.</i> IV. <i>Lodowick Carly</i>, the
King’s Physician, and <i>John Mewtes</i>, Secretary of the
<i>French</i> Tongue, both <i>Temp. Hen.</i> VII. and <i>Bartholomew
Westby</i> made second Baron of the <i>Exchequer</i>, 1
<i>Hen.</i> VIII.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>It</span> is evident King <i>Hen.</i> VIII. designed a Re-establishment
of half the ancient Number of Alms-Knights,
<i>viz.</i> Thirteen; for which purpose he appointed
by his Will 600 <i>l.</i> <i>per Annum</i>, in Mannors, Lands, and
Spiritual Promotions, settled upon the Dean and Canons,
and their Successors for ever, upon the Proviso’s that
they should find Two Priests to say Mass at his Tomb,
to commemorate yearly Four Obits for him, and at
every Obit distribute 12 <i>l.</i> in Alms, likewise to pay
12 <i>d.</i> a Week to those Thirteen Alms-Knights, who
were to have once a Year a long Gown of White Cloth,
and a Mantle of Red, besides Five Marks annually, to
such one among them as should be constituted their Governor,
and so much for a Sermon every <i>Sunday</i> throughout
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>the Year. In Performance of which Will, King
<i>Edw.</i> VI. in the first Year of his Reign, did confer several
Lands upon the College; but 600 <i>l.</i> <i>per Annum</i> of
these Rents were by the Dean and Canons paid back,
to be employed on erecting of Houses for the Alms-Knights,
intended to be settled by King <i>Hen.</i> VIII. This
Work began not till the 3d and 4th of <i>Philip</i> and <i>Mary</i>,
and was finished the 5th and 6th of their Reign, the
Charge amounting to 2747 <i>l.</i> 7 <i>s.</i> 6 <i>d.</i> These Houses are
situate on the South side of the Lower Ward of the
Castle, and contain Thirteen Rooms, besides an Hall,
a Kitchin, and a Pastry; the Stone was brought from
<i>Reading</i>, the Timber from the Forest, and the Lead,
and Apparels for the Chimnies, from <i>Suffolk Place</i> in
<i>Southwark</i>. At a Chapter of the <i>Garter</i>, held the 1st of
<i>June</i>, the 4th and 5th of <i>Philip</i> and <i>Mary</i>, the Houses
being then near finished, a Debate arose about placing
some Alms-Knights therein, if possible, by <i>Michaelmas</i>
following, whereupon the Marquiss of <i>Winton</i>, Lord-Treasurer,
had Orders to assign Lands for their Maintenance;
and towards the compleating of this the Queen
had nominated Nine of the Thirteen designed; but falling
sick in <i>August</i>, a stop was put to the Affair, till Queen
<i>Elizabeth</i> coming to the Crown confirmed her Sister’s
Grants to the Nine nominated Knights, and made up
the Number full Thirteen, ordained by King <i>Henry</i> VIII.
under which Establishment they still remain; for afterwards,
<i>viz.</i> <i>Aug.</i> 30. in the first Year of her Reign,
minding the Continuance of King <i>Edward</i>’s Foundation,
the Intent of her Progenitors, and Advancement of the
Order of the <i>Garter</i>, and King <i>Henry</i> VIII’s Will, for the
Support of Thirteen poor Men decayed in Wars, to be
called Thirteen Knights of <i>Windsor</i>; and having erected
certain Orders for their better Regulation, and declar’d
how and in what manner the 600 <i>l.</i> given by her
Father should be employ’d for the Maintenance of these
Knights and their Successors, she lastly declared, That
the Dean and Canons should for ever cause these Rules
and Orders to be observed.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Impr.</i> That there be Thirteen Poor Knights, all Gentlemen,
one whereof to be Governour, that have spent
their Time in the Wars, or other Service of the Realm,
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>having little or nothing to live upon, to be elected by
the Sovereign and Successors.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. <i>It.</i> The Governour and Knights must be unmarried,

<p class='c000'>5. <i>It.</i> An Escutcheon of St. <i>George</i> embroidered without
the <i>Garter</i>, to be upon the Left Shoulder of the
Mantle.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. <i>It.</i> The Charges of the Cloth, Lining, Making,
and Embroidering, to be paid by the Dean and Chapter,
out of the Revenue of the Foundation.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. <i>It.</i> That the Knights attend, Morning and Afternoon,
Divine Service, within the College, in their ordinary
Apparel, without a reasonable Let to be allowed

<p class='c000'>8. <i>It.</i> That they keep their Lodgings appointed, and
Table in a common Hall appointed, and to have their

Cause any be licensed to the contrary by the Dean, and
that License not to endure above Twenty Days in a Year,
excepting only for Sickness.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. <i>It.</i> They are not to haunt the Town, nor Publick
Houses, nor call any Woman into their Lodgings, without
reasonable Cause and License of the Dean.</p>

Governour, in any of these Statutes, to incur the Forfeiture
the Dean and Chapter shall put on him, the Governour

the Dean and Chapter are to give a Warning, and register
the same, and after a second Warning Expulsion is
to follow; the like Punishment to the Governour, disobeying
the Dean and Chapter in the Observation of
these Statutes.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. <i>It.</i> The Penalties of the Punished to be imployed
by the Dean and Chapter at their Discretion, upon any
of the Ministers or Choristers of the Church.</p>

<p class='c000'>15. <i>It.</i> Upon the King or Queen’s coming to or going
from <i>Windsor</i>, the Thirteen Knights are to stand
before their Doors in their Apparel, and do Obedience.</p>

<p class='c000'>16. <i>It.</i> At the keeping of the Feast of St. <i>George</i>, they
are to stand likewise in their Apparel before their Doors,
at the coming and going out of the Lieutenant, and of
other the Knights-Companions.</p>

<p class='c000'>17. <i>It.</i> At every Feast of St. <i>George</i> they shall sit together
in their Apparel at one Table, and have Allowance
of Meat and Drink at the Royal Charges.</p>

<p class='c000'>18. <i>It.</i> They are daily in their Prayers to pray for the

<p class='c000'>19. <i>It.</i> They are always to lie in their Lodging, and
upon lying out of them and the College, without License
from the Dean, to forfeit 12 <i>d.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>20. <i>It.</i> If Lands or Revenues of 20 <i>l.</i> <i>per Annum</i> fall
to any of the poor Knights, he is to be removed, and
another put into his Place.</p>

<p class='c000'>21. <i>It.</i> They are every Day (excepting Cause of Sickness)
to be present at Divine Service in the College, as
aforesaid, and receive a daily Distribution of 12 <i>d.</i> <i>per</i>
Day, to be paid them monthly, if it may be, or at least
in such sort as the other Ministers of the Chapel be
paid; and he that shall absent himself one Day, without

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> 25th Article is a Dispensation for those poor
Knights chosen before these Statutes, who were not certainly
known Gentlemen, yet Men well reported for
Honesty, and meet to be relieved; but with an Intent
that none hereafter be admitted, unless a Gentleman
born, agreeable to the first Order.</p>

<p class='c000'>The annual Allowance of each, upon this new Establishment,
is 18 <i>l.</i> 5 <i>s.</i> to be paid by the Dean of <i>Windsor</i>,
(but their Governour has 3 <i>l.</i> 6 <i>s.</i> and 8 <i>d.</i> more)
besides their Gown and Mantle mentioned in their Statutes.
King <i>James</i> I. doubled this Pension, and made it
payable out of the Exchequer quarterly.</p>

<p class='c000'>To these Thirteen Alms-Knights, <i>temp. Car.</i> I. Five
more were added, Two of the Foundation of Sir <i>Peter
la Maire</i>, Knight, and Three of Sir <i>Francis Crane</i>, Knight,
Chancellor of the Garter; for Sir <i>Peter</i>, by his last Will,
dated <i>Jan.</i> 8. 1631. bequeath’d 1500 <i>l.</i> to charitable
Uses, to be dispos’d as Sir <i>Francis</i> (who had marry’d
his Sister) should think fit, within Four Years after
his Death; whereupon Sir <i>Francis</i>, determining to erect
certain Houses in <i>Windsor</i>-Castle, for the dwelling of
Five Alms-Knights, design’d the said 1500 <i>l.</i> towards
that Use, and what was deficient made up at his own
Cost, charging his Brother Executor, Sir <i>Richard Crane</i>,
by his Will, dated <i>Aug.</i> 27. 1635. to see the Pile which
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>he had began, finish’d. Sir <i>Francis</i> also bequeath’d 200 <i>l.</i>
<i>per Annum</i> to be settled in Lands, by his Executors, for
the perpetual Maintenance of Five Alms-Knights, after
the rate of 40 <i>l.</i> <i>per Annum</i> to every one of them; but
his Executor growing slack in the Performance, the
Work being rather expos’d to Ruin, than forwarded by
him; upon Complaints made to the Sovereign and
Knights-Companions in Chapter, Orders were issu’d
out to quicken him, and a peremptory Letter, dated
<i>Mar.</i> 7. 1639. to go on with the Work faithfully; which
Commands he evading, and bad Times coming on,
the Building was totally neglected. Sir <i>Richard Crane</i>
afterward dying, by his Will, dated <i>Sept.</i> 20. 1645. he
appointed that his Mannor of <i>Carbrooke</i> in <i>Norfolk</i>, should
stand bound for ever for Payment of the said 200 <i>l.</i> <i>per
Annum</i>; whereupon, by Inquisition taken at <i>Windsor</i>,
<i>Mar.</i> 4. 1652. (by Virtue of a Commission upon the
Statute <i>Anno</i> 43 <i>Eliz.</i> for charitable Uses) the Mannors
of <i>Woodrising</i> and <i>Wesfield</i>, &amp;c. in <i>Norfolk</i>, were found
liable to satisfie for building and finishing the said Five
Houses, and payment of the 200 <i>l.</i> yearly; and further,
that the Arrears thereof, from Sir <i>Francis Crane</i>’s Death,
came at that time to 3200 <i>l.</i> some Contest ensu’d in
<i>Chancery</i>; nevertheless the 200 <i>l.</i> <i>per Annum</i> was, <i>July</i>
19. 1655. decreed to be paid out of all the Lands
which were Sir <i>Richard</i>’s, and the building of the
Houses out of his personal Estate. At Two Years Expiration
arose that fair Pile of Building, between the
Chancellor’s and Garter’s Towers, against the West
Wall, in the lower Ward of the Castle, which was begun
again and finish’d the next Year; the Expences
amounting to 1700 <i>l.</i> But for a final End of this Suit,
it was decreed, <i>Jan.</i> 27. 1659. the Mannor of <i>Carbrooke</i>
should stand charg’d with 200 <i>l.</i> <i>per Annum</i>, payable
half-yearly at <i>Michaelmas</i> and <i>Lady-day</i>, or within Thirty
Days after, for the Maintenance of Five Alms-Knights,
together with 30 <i>l.</i> yearly for Repairs, payable also
then; which annual Sum of 230 <i>l.</i> <i>Anno</i> 12 <i>Car.</i> II. in
a Chapter held at <i>Whitehall</i>, <i>Jan.</i> 14. the King decreed
the Chancellor of the Order, for the Time being,
should receive and dispose thereof thus: 200 <i>l.</i> <i>per
Annum</i> among the Five new Alms-Knights quarterly, at
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>the Four usual Feasts of the Year, and to employ the
residue upon Repair of the new Buildings erected for
their Lodgings; which Powers were inserted in the
Patent for his Office, bearing date the 20th of the same
Month. And it was moreover decreed, that these Five
Knights should be subject to the same Rules and Government
of the Thirteen of Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>’s Foundation,
and made equal Partakers of the same Privileges,
and wear the like Habits.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>King</span> <i>Charles</i> I. taking into Consideration the Donation
of Sir <i>Francis Crane</i>, which made the Alms-Knights
Eighteen, (tho’ they were not yet settled) intended to
make up Twenty Six, as they were at the Institution
of the Order; to compleat which Design, a Chapter was
held at <i>Whitehall</i>, <i>Apr.</i> 18. 1637. for the Knights-Companions
to consider the best Way how the same might
be effected, and report their Opinions; but nothing
was done thereupon, and this Affair waits a more propitious
Opportunity.</p>

<p class='c008'>§ 6. <span class='sc'>The</span> other Ministers of the College and Chapel
of St. <i>George</i>, call’d <i>Ministers</i> in the Foundation Patent,
are the superior Officers, <i>viz.</i> The Chantor, Steward
and Treasurer.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Chantor is elected from among the Canons,
whose Office is chiefly to govern those that sing in the
Choir, and such as are employ’d about Divine Service.
Before the Reformation he appointed who should begin
the Antiphones, celebrate Masses, and read the Lessons,
Epistles and Gospels. To his Care was committed
all the Books, Crosses, Chalices, Vestments, and all
the Sacred Ornaments of the Chapel. He receives the
Offerings there made, and Accounts for them; for all
which Services an annual Pension of 5 <i>l.</i> is allow’d
him.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Steward and Treasurer are annually chosen on
the Morrow after <i>Michaelmas-day</i> from out of the Canons
Resident. To the Steward’s Office appertains the Government
of all the Revenues of the College, the Rents
and Profits whereof he is to pay the Treasurer. In his
Custody are repos’d all the Ornaments, Jewels, and other
Treasure of the Chapel, not committed to the
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>Chantor, under the Obligation of rendring an Account;

which if he fail Eight Days after their prefix’d Times
of Payment, he is debar’d of his own <i>quotidians</i>, as Canon
Resident, until such Arrears be discharg’d; as likewise
the Steward, if he be found delinquent. His
Pension is also 5 <i>l.</i> <i>per Annum</i>. There is one Treasurer
to receive the Rents of the old Lands, and another chosen
from the Canons to receive the new, who have
been allow’d the like annual Pensions. The former is
term’d <i>Seneschallus veteris</i>, the latter <i>Seneschallus novæ Dotationis</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Moreover</span>, there is a Steward of the Courts, and
Clerk of the Lands, which is an Officer under both
the before-mention’d Stewards. He keeps the Courts
by himself or Deputy, and is a Barrester at Law, and
the standing Council for the College. His yearly Pension
is 20 Nobles. But the Council <i>in Spiritualibus</i> is
usually a Graduate in the Law.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Chapter-Clerk enters and registers all Acts of
the Chapter-House; he draws and engrosses all Indentures,
Patents, Grants, Leases, <i>&amp;c.</i> which pass the common
Seal of the Dean and Canons. His Pension is 3 <i>l.</i> 6 <i>s.</i>
8 <i>d.</i> <i>per Annum</i>. The Under Stewardship and Chapter
Clerkship heretofore were enjoy’d by one Person, but
of late they are divided, and now he must be a Barrester
at Law.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Of</span> the Virgers Institution the Statutes of the College
make mention, that in Procession and other Solemnities,
they were to go before the Dean and Canons,
bearing their Rods, for which Service they were to have
annually a Robe, and 6 <i>d.</i> <i>per Diem</i>. And besides these,
there are Two Sextons, Two Bell-ringers, a Clock-keeper,
and a Porter who attends the shutting and opening
of the Gates.</p>

<p class='c008'>§ 7. <span class='sc'>For</span> the Endowment of the College we shall
only treat upon those Lands given to the Maintenance
of this Foundation by the Founder himself, or by his
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>Successors, or by Sovereigns of <i>The Order of the Garter</i>,
such as have been Knights-Companions.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>King</span> <i>Edw.</i> III. by his Letters Patent of the Foundation
[22 <i>Edw.</i> III.] aforesaid, gave them [the Custos,
Canons, Alms-Knights and Ministers] the Advowsons
of the Churches of <i>Wyardesbury</i> [<i>Rasbury</i>] in <i>Lincoln</i>,
<i>South-Tanton</i> in <i>Exeter</i>, and <i>Uttoxater</i> in <i>Coventry</i> and
<i>Litchfield</i> Diocess, in Frank Almoigne, free from all Secular
Exactions; which License, to appropriate the
same to the College, notwithstanding the Statute of
<i>Mortmain</i>, he appointed as much out of his Treasure
for their Support, as amounted to an immoveable Estate
of 1000 <i>l.</i> <i>per Annum</i>; and lest there might be any Defect
in the Knights Title to <i>Uttoxater</i> and <i>South-Tanton</i>,
<i>Henry</i> Earl of <i>Lancaster</i>, 23 <i>Edw.</i> III. and <i>Thomas Beauchamp</i>
Earl of <i>Warwick</i>, that Year had special Licenses
granted them in Right of Patronage to the said Two Advowsons,
and they to receive the same. Another such
License, 28th of <i>January</i>, 24 <i>Edw.</i> III. was given to
<i>William de Bohun</i> Earl of <i>Northampton</i>, for assigning to
the Custos and Chaplains the Advowson of <i>Dodyngton</i> in
<i>Com. Oxon</i>, which he held of the King <i>in Capite</i>. The
28th of <i>January</i> following, this Royal Founder conferr’d
on them (by the Name of Custos and Chaplains of his
free Chapel at <i>Windsor</i>) one Messuage, Seventeen Acres
of Land, one of Pasture, and 3 <i>s.</i> Rent, in <i>Wyrardesbury</i>
in <i>Com. Bucks</i>, which had been convey’d to him by <i>Richard
de Gloucester</i>, Heir to <i>Isabel de Ditton</i>; and the 22d
of <i>May</i> ensuing granted unto them the Advowson of
<i>Dachet</i> near <i>Windsor</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Anno</i> 25 <i>Edw.</i> III. the King gave them the Advowsons
of the Churches of <i>Eure</i> in <i>Com. Bucks</i>, of <i>Riston</i> in
<i>Com. Norfolk</i>, and of <i>Whaddon</i> and <i>Caxton</i> in <i>Com. Cantab.</i>,
and in <i>May</i> that Year the Advowson of <i>Simondesbourne</i>
(surrender’d <i>temp. Edw.</i> IV. to <i>Richard</i> Duke of
<i>Gloucester</i>) and of St. <i>Stephens</i> of <i>Saltash</i>. The first of
these Queen <i>Philippa</i> purchas’d of Sir <i>John Darcy</i>, and
the other of <i>Edward</i> the Black Prince; and gave them
both, first to the King, that by his Grant afterwards to
the College its Title might be more corroborated.
The same Year, <i>October</i> 26. the King bestow’d on them
100 Marks <i>per Annum</i>, out of the Farm of the Town
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>of <i>Northampton</i>, to be paid by the Bailiff of the Town
at <i>Easter</i> and <i>Michaelmas</i> by equal Allotments: And it
was at the Founder’s Instance (therefore worthy to be
inserted) that the Town of <i>Yarmouth</i>, 26 <i>Edw.</i> III. under
their Common Seal, granted them a Last of Red
Herrings yearly, well dry’d and cleans’d, to take the
Corporation into their Prayers; tho’ some say it was a
Penance enjoyn’d them for murdering a Magistrate.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> the 26 <i>Edw.</i> III. the Founder granted them and
their Successors the Mannor of <i>Eure</i> near <i>Weybrigg</i>, in
<i>Com. Bucks</i>, the Mannor of <i>Craswell</i> in <i>Bray</i> in <i>Com. Berks</i>,
and a Wear call’d <i>Braybrook</i>, situated in the <i>Thames</i>,
with all the Lands in that Parish convey’d unto him
by Sir <i>John Philibert</i>, together with the Knights Fees,
Advowsons, <i>&amp;c.</i> belonging to those Mannors. He
gave to the Custos and College soon after the Seisin
thereof, as also of a Wood call’d <i>Temple-Wood</i> in <i>Stoke-Pogeys</i>,
convey’d to the King by <i>John de Molyns</i>: But
deeming all the Lands too small for the End he intended,
28 <i>Edw.</i> III. the King granted the Custos and
College, by Letters Patent, a Pension of 100 <i>l.</i> <i>per Annum</i>
out of the Exchequer; and upon the vacating the
same, 34 <i>Edw.</i> III. he gave them yearly Lands of 101 <i>l.</i>
11 <i>s.</i> 11 <i>d.</i> out of the Possessions of religious Aliens,
which fell into his Hands by Occasion of the <i>French</i>
Wars: But lest these Possessions should be again restor’d
upon a Treaty of Peace, they were to receive
the annual Sum of 101 <i>l.</i> 11 <i>s.</i> 11 <i>d.</i> out of the Exchequer,
till they were provided of Lands of the like
Value. Upon several Restrictions, he granted them
51 <i>l.</i> 9 <i>s.</i> 9 <i>d.</i> yearly to be receiv’d out of 126 <i>l.</i> which
the Prior of <i>Takkele</i> paid him for the Farm of that Priory,
it being then in the King’s Hand by reason of the
War with <i>France</i>. And by reason the Revenues did
not amount to 1000 <i>l</i>. <i>per Annum</i>, as he design’d at
the Foundation, in the 35th Year of his Reign, he
granted them so much Money yearly out of the Exchequer,
as would make up the Deficiency, till Lands
or Rents of that Value should be settled on them.
Lastly, 39 <i>Edw.</i> III. the Founder bestow’d on them a
Piece of Ground in <i>New Windsor</i>, (whereon had stood an
House of <i>John</i> of <i>London</i>) in lieu of the great Garden
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>South of the Castle, formerly given them by him; and
also a Garden opposite thereunto on the other side of
the Way. Besides these Largesses of the Founders,
there were others made by pious and devout Persons,
said to be incorporated into the first Foundation, and
made up that Revenue which <i>William</i> Bishop of <i>Winchester</i>
adjudg’d sufficient for the Support of the College,
which we shall silently pass over with the bare
mention only.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Mannor of <i>Dodyngton</i>-Castle; two Pastures call’d
<i>Frith</i> and <i>Ashcroft</i>; the Chapel of <i>Langeley</i>; the Parsonages

<i>Wedonbeek</i>, <i>Glynde</i> and <i>Ryslepe</i>; the Pensions of the Vicarages
of <i>Wantynge</i>, <i>Clyffe</i>, <i>Tylthey</i> and <i>Gottesford</i>; and

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> succeeding Times other considerable Donations
were made by the Sovereigns and Knights Companions
(omitting others.) Some of which, as they fall
in our way, we shall speak of.</p>

<p class='c000'>13 <i>Rich.</i> II. that King gave them a Croft in <i>Northmolton</i>,
with the Advowson of that Church.</p>

<p class='c000'>9 <i>Hen.</i> V. <i>John</i>, Duke of <i>Bedford</i>, third Son to King
<i>Hen.</i> IV. conferr’d on them the Priory of <i>Okeborne</i> in
<i>Wilts</i> (a Cell to <i>Bec</i> in <i>Normandy</i>) with all its Appurtenances:
Which Donation was confirm’d by King <i>Hen.</i> V.
and afterwards by King <i>Edw.</i> IV.</p>

<p class='c000'>7 <i>Edw.</i> IV. that King, who had a singular Respect
for the College, conferr’d on them the Mannor of
<i>Atherston</i> in <i>Com. Warwick</i>, the Mannors and Advowsons
of <i>Chesingbury</i> in <i>Wilts</i>, and of <i>Quarle</i> in <i>Hantshire</i>; the
Church and Priorate of <i>Uphaven</i>, and the Deanry or
Chapel of St. <i>Burien</i> in <i>Cornwall</i>, with an Addition of
an annual Pension, which the Abbot of <i>Sautrie</i> discharg’d
for the Church of <i>Fulburne</i>, to the Abbey <i>de bona Requie</i>,
and another yearly Income of 20 <i>l.</i> paid by the Abbot of
<i>Rousford</i> for the Mediety of the Church of <i>Rotheram</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>13 <i>Edw.</i> IV. he consign’d to them the Mannor or
Priorate of <i>Munclane</i>, in <i>Com. Hereford</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>14 <i>Edw.</i> IV. he gave unto them the Custody, Patronage,

of St. <i>Anthony</i>, <i>London</i>, (a Preceptory to St. <i>Anthony</i>
of <i>Vienna</i>, with all the Liberties, Privileges, Lands, <i>&amp;c.</i>)
upon the first Vacancy. The same Year he endow’d

Mannor of <i>Blakenham</i> in <i>Suffolk</i>; the Priorate of St. <i>Elene</i>
in the <i>Isle of Wight</i>; the Priorate or Mannor of <i>Charleton</i>

of <i>Puryton</i> and <i>Wollavington</i> in that County, together

<p class='c000'>18 <i>Edw.</i> IV. his Feoffees, the Queen, the Arch-Bishop

demis’d to them the Mannor of <i>Wykecombe</i>, call’d <i>Bassetsbury</i>,
the Fee-Farm of the Town of <i>Great Wykecombe</i>,
the Mannor of <i>Crendon</i> in <i>Com. Bucks</i>, and the Mannors
of <i>Haseley</i> and <i>Pyrton</i> in <i>Com. Oxon</i>: And that Year the
King gave unto them the Advowson of the Church of
<i>Cheshunt</i>, being of his own Patronage, provided the Vicarige
was sufficiently endow’d, and a compleat Sum
of Money annually distributed among the poor Parishioners,
according to the Diocesan’s Ordinance. To these
he united the Custody or Deanry of the Free Chapel of
<i>Wolverhampton</i> in <i>Com. Staff</i>. to the Custos or Dean of
this College, and his Successors for ever; which
Church, <i>cum membris</i>, is exempt from not only the Jurisdiction,

but by a Papal Bull from all Legates and Delegates;
nor is it subject to any terrene Power, but the King of

of the Keepers of the Great Seal, <i>pro tempore</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>20 <i>Edw.</i> IV. he resign’d to them the Advowson or
Patronage of the Prebend of <i>Ewern</i> in <i>Com. Dorset</i>, with
all its Rights and Privileges: And lastly, in the 21st
Year of his Reign, he granted them Two Parts of the
Mannors of <i>Old Swynford</i> and <i>Gannow</i>, in <i>Com. Wygorn</i>.
and the Reversion of the Third Part of them, with
the Advowson of the Church of <i>Old Swynford</i>; nor was
he thus munificent alone, but excited and spurr’d on
others to the like Example, licensing, in the first Year
of his Reign, all his Subjects to confer what they
pleas’d to the Dean and Canons, within the Value of
300 Marks <i>per Annum</i>, as well such as held of him <i>in
Capite</i> or otherwise, notwithstanding the Statute of
<i>Mortmain</i>; and afterwards increas’d this License to
Lands of 500 <i>l.</i> <i>per Annum</i> Value, (which King <i>Hen.</i> VIII.
extended to 1000 <i>l.</i>) Hereupon, <i>Anno</i> 20 <i>Edw.</i> IV.
<i>John</i>, Duke of <i>Suffolk</i>, and <i>Elizabeth</i> his Wife, the King’s
Sister, were permitted to assign to them the Mannor or
Lordship of <i>Grovebury</i>, otherwise call’d <i>Leighton Busard</i>,

also Nineteen Messuages, Seven Tofts, One Hundred

Forty of Pasture, and Twenty Shillings Rent, in
<i>Stodeham</i>, in <i>Com. Hertford</i>, held of the King <i>in Capite</i>,
without any Restriction whatsoever, for which the
Duke and Dutchess were to be had in the perpetual
Orisons of the Dean and Canons. The same Year
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>Sir <i>Walter Devoreux de Feners</i>, Knight, together with
Sir <i>John Devoreux</i> and others his Feofees, made over to

<p class='c000'>All the before-mentioned Endowments are called the
Lands of the old Dotation, to distinguish them from
those confirmed on the College by King <i>Edw.</i> VI. which
are term’d the Lands of the new Dotation; of which
hereafter. But several of them given by King <i>Edw.</i> IV.
the College never possessed, <i>viz.</i> <i>Atherston</i>, <i>Quarle</i>, <i>Uphaven</i>,

<i>Charleton</i>, <i>Blakenham</i>, <i>Ponyngton</i>, <i>Wedon</i>, <i>Old Swynford</i>,
and <i>Gannow</i>, and of some others they were seized but
a short time, <i>viz.</i> <i>Chesingbury</i>, the Lands in <i>Newford</i>,
<i>Blandford</i>, and <i>Portsmouth</i>. Besides these, the College
was dispossess’d of <i>Gottesford</i>, <i>temp. Hen.</i> VI. of <i>Cheshunt</i>,

<i>Rowhand</i>, <i>Kingston</i>, <i>Esthenreth</i>, <i>Northmundon</i>, <i>Compton</i>,
<i>Weleg</i>, <i>Compton St. John</i>, and <i>Shobingdon</i> Portion; and upon
the <i>Reformation</i> the College lost at least 1000 Marks
<i>per Annum</i>, in the Profit made by St. <i>Anthony</i>’s Piggs,
which the Appropriation of the Hospital of St. <i>Anthony</i>’s
<i>London</i> brought to it, and no less then 500 <i>per Annum</i>,
the Offerings of Sir <i>John Shorne</i>’s Shrine at <i>Northmarston</i>
in <i>Com. Bucks</i>, a Man of great Piety and Veneration
with the People, and sometime Rector there. The
Advowson of this Church was appropriated to the Dean

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> ancient Rate of these New Lands in the King’s
Books was 661 <i>l.</i> 6 <i>s.</i> and 8 <i>d.</i> <i>per Annum</i>; but according
to the improved Rents, as they were then turned
over to the College, 812 <i>l.</i> 12 <a id='sm' name='sm'></a><i>s</i>. 9 <i>d.</i> out of which
160 <i>l.</i> 2 <i>s.</i> 4 <i>d.</i> was yearly allowed them in Requital of

for accomplishment of his Will; but the remaining
Sum, <i>viz.</i> 52 <i>l.</i> 10 <i>s.</i> 5 <i>d.</i> was reserved in lieu of
Tenths, to be paid into the Court of <i>Augmentation</i>; nevertheless,
this last reserved Sum was not assented unto
by the Dean and Canons to be so paid, because the
Charges issuing out of the Lands were larger than were
expressed in the Rental. And we find that, shortly after,
the Rents of St. <i>Germains</i>, <i>Northam</i>, <i>Ilsington</i>, &amp;c.
part of the New Lands, were received and accounted
for, according to the old Rate in the King’s books, to
wit, 162 <i>l.</i> 13 <i>s.</i> 4 <i>d.</i> <i>per Annum</i>, in Recompence for the
Lands conveyed to King <i>Hen.</i> VIII. and out of which
they paid a yearly Surplusage of 2 <i>l.</i> 2 <i>s.</i> 1 <i>d.</i> This Sum,

being upon the said Improvement accounted to be 597 <i>l.</i>
17 <i>s.</i> 11 <i>d.</i> made in all 600 <i>l.</i> <i>per Annum</i>; and this was
laid out by the Dean and Canons for some time towards
erecting the Alms-Knights Apartments.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Thus</span> stood the Lands accounted for till the Settlement

Sign manual, and annexed to an Indenture made between
her and the Dean and Canons; by which Indenture
they were obliged to apply the Rents and Profits of
these Lands, as was prescribed in the Book, and to observe
the Ordinances therein, and upon Default, to abide

of Tenths to the Crown, Vicars, Curates, Annual Stipends,
Officers Fees, Reparation of the Premisses,
and for the Relief of the Dean and Canons, in Maintenance
and Defence of the said Lands.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>And</span> to the End the Queen might know how the Revenue
was disposed of, she gave charge that her Lieutenant
and the Knights-Companions should annually (at
the Feast of the Order held at <i>Windsor</i>) state the Accompt,
and see how the Income was expended, and that
her Lieutenant should yearly be put in mind of it by
one of the Officers of the Order. This Ordinance was
renewed, 21 <i>Jac.</i> I. and the Chancellor of the Order
was appointed to be the Remembrancer, and in Obedience
thereunto, the Account of these new Lands (which
begins at <i>Lady-Day</i>, as that of the old Lands doth at
<i>Michaelmas</i>) was afterwards exhibited in Chapter, and
in particular that Account, 9 <i>Car.</i> I. which was submitted
to the Sovereign and Knights-Companion’s Consideration,
who referred the Inspection thereof to the
Knights-Commissaries, who were to consult over the
Affairs of the Order.</p>

<p class='c000'>§. 8. <span class='sc'>The</span> Privileges of the Chapel and College are
Ecclesiastical and Temporal: As to the first, Pope <i>Clement</i>
VI. exempted the Chapel, College, Canons, Priests,
Clerks, Alms-Knights and Officers, from all ordinary
Jurisdiction of Archbishops, Bishops, Archdeacons,
and all Judges and Officers, and received them within
the Protection of the Papal-See; and granted a farther
Privilege, That the Custos should have Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction over the Canons, Priests, <i>&amp;c.</i> as also the
Cure of their Souls, notwithstanding any Papal Constitution,
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>Provincial, or Synodical, yet allowing that the
Custos should receive that Cure from the Diocesan of the
Place. In Consideration of this Exemption, the Custos
was to pay annually, on St. <i>George</i>’s Day, a Mark in Silver,
to the Pope’s Chamber. Two Years preceding,
the Chapel was called the King’s Free Chapel, which
Title it still enjoys; for it owes Subjection to none but
the Sovereign of <i>England</i>, the Supream of the Church,
as heretofore it stood divided between the King and See
of <i>Rome</i>. The Privilege of Exemption included in
the Confirmation of Liberties, made by the Founder in
his Charter, dated <i>Anno Regni sui</i> 47. and all other Emoluments
granted by him, are confirmed by Act of
Parliament, 8 <i>Hen.</i> VI. As the College has its sole Dependance
on the Crown, it is visitable only by the
Lord-Chancellor, whose Visitations and Power are reserved
to him by the Statutes of the College, and himself
called in the King’s Commission for Visitation,
2 <i>Rich.</i> II. Governor of the said Chapel, as well in Spirituals
as Temporals, and, under the King, immediate
Custos. And so jealous were the Dean and Canons, lest
the Power of the said Exemption should be infringed,
that when <i>Sixtus</i> IV. had granted the Bishop of <i>Salisbury</i>,
and themselves, to make new and interpret the
ancient Statutes, they soon obtained a Revocation of
that Authority, lest the said Bishop (in whose Diocess
the College is situate) being so unpowered, might by
Degrees bring them under his Jurisdiction, in prejudice
to their Exemption. And, <i>A. D.</i> 1485. to prevent
such design, the Archbishop of <i>Canterbury</i>, &amp;c. were
commission’d to see the Bull revoked, and <i>Salisbury</i> enjoyned
not to intermeddle further in the College Affairs.
Moreover other Bishops, and the Chancellor of <i>England</i>,
were to renew, alter, or new make such Statutes as
might accrue to the Advantage of the College.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>If</span> the Archbishop of <i>Canterbury</i> be present in the
Chapel, he sits below the Dean, nor can he consecrate
there, without his License. And this is very remarkable,
that at the ratifying the Peace between King
<i>Charles</i> I. and <i>Lewis</i> XIII. <i>A. D.</i> 1629. in the Chapel at
<i>Windsor</i>, Dr. <i>Wren</i>, then Dean of the College, gave the
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>Oath to the <i>French</i> Ambassador, and not the Archbishop
of <i>Canterbury</i>, tho’ he was then present.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Dean and Chapter are to weigh well and debate
at their yearly Chapters all things fit to be dispatched in
reference to the College Affairs, and whatsoever Determination
they come to, not repugnant to their Statutes,
all Persons are firmly obliged to observe.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Deans have no Institution from any Bishop, but
his Institution, Investiture, and Installation into the
Custos-ship, Canonship, and Prebendship, is conferred
from such of the Canons Resident, to whom the King
(who collates) doth recommend him. Other Marks of
Exemption appear in the constant proving of Wills before
him, or in his Absence before his Lieutenant. In
using the Power of Excommunication within their Jurisdiction
(the Precincts of the College) granting a Dispensation
for eating Flesh in <i>Lent</i>, a farther Mark of
their Privilege appears, that the Ordination for the
Chantry Priests were confirmed by the Dean and Chapter,
and not the Bishop of the Diocess, as were the
Statutes of the new Commons. The Dean is exempt
from paying all Synodals, or Procurations, nor can any
of the King’s Chaplains preach in the Chapel of
St. <i>George</i>, unless he be a Canon there, or have License
from the King, or from the Dean and Canons. They
send no Delegates to the Synod, and when the Point
was debated, 1640. it was carried in the Negative, as
being against their Liberties, and might intitle them to
the Payment of Subsidies; nor are they intitled to any
Share in the Government of the Church, more than the
Colleges in the Universities, where there are many nominal
Deans. In short, when by the Act of <i>Uniformity</i>,
14 <i>Car.</i> II. every Clergyman was bound to subscribe before
the Archbishop or his Ordinary, the Canons subscribed
before the Dean; and tho’ some of them subscribed
before the Bishop, yet was it with a Salvo,
saving the Rights and Privileges of this Free Chapel.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Their</span> Temporal Immunities and Privileges are these,
as granted them by Charter, 6 <i>Mar.</i> 27 <i>Edw.</i> III. and
confirmed by several of his Successors.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Custos and Canons were free from paying Aid
upon making the King’s eldest Son a Knight, and marrying
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>his eldest Daughter, and exempt of all Aids to the
King’s Contributions and Tallages.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Whensoever</span> the Clergy should give a Tenth, or other
Imposition, out of their Spiritualties, or the Commons
give a Tenth, Fifteenth, or other, out of their
Temporalties, Subsidy, or the King tax his own Demean,
or the Pope impose any Money to be raised upon
the Clergy, to give it the King, this College and
their Possessions were to stand freed thereof.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>They</span> were discharged from any Contributions of

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch05' class='c005'>CAP. V.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c007'><span class='sc'>We</span> come now to treat of the most Noble and Illustrious
<i>Order of the Garter</i>; which, if we consider
either its Antiquity, or the Nobleness of
the Personages, that have been enroll’d, it excels and
outvies all other Institutions of Honour in the whole
World. It owes its Original, as is confessed on all
Hands, to <i>Edward</i> III. King of <i>England</i> and <i>France</i>; yet as
to the Occasion, there are several Opinions which we
shall rectifie. The vulgar and more general is, that the
Garter of <i>Joan</i>, Countess of <i>Salisbury</i>, dropping casually
off as she danced in a solemn Ball, King <i>Edward</i> stooping
took it up from the Ground, whereupon some of
his Nobles smiling, as at an amorous Action, and he
observing their sportive Humour, turned it off with a
Reply in <i>French</i>, <i>Honi soit qui mal y pense</i>; but withal
added, in disdain of their Laughter, <i>That shortly they
should see that Garter advanced to so high an Honour and Renown
as to account themselves happy to wear it</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>But</span> upon Examination of this Tradition, let others
judge what Credit it bears to establish its Belief; for
Sir <i>John Froissart</i>, the only Writer of the Age that treats
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>of this Institution, assigns no such Original, nor for
200 Years after is there any thing to the Purpose in our
other Historians, till <i>Polydore Virgil</i> took occasion to say
something of it; but had it been Fact, some <i>French</i>
Historian or other, would not have neglected to register
it at a convenient Time with a Scoff and Ridicule,
since that Nation was so ready to deride King <i>Henry</i> V’s
Design of invading them with a Return of Tennis
Balls.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> the Original Statutes of this Order, there is not
the least Conjecture to countenance the Conceit of such
a Feminine Institution, no not so much as laying an
Obligation on the Knights-Companions to defend the
Quarrels of Ladies (as some Orders then in being enjoyned;)
nor doth the Author of that Tract entitled <i>Institutio
clarissimi Ordinis Militaris a prænobili subligaculo nuncupati</i>,
prefaced to the Black Book of the <i>Garter</i>, let fall
the manifest Passage to ground it on.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>As</span> to what <i>Polydore</i> says, he is not so confident to
ascertain the Person whose Garter it was; but cautiously
declining that, says, it was either the Queen’s, or the
King’s Mistress’s; and if it were the latter, yet doth he omit
her Name and Title, both which (on what Authority
we find not) are supplied by modern Historians, who call
her <i>Joan</i> Countess of <i>Salisbury</i>, the same elsewhere celebrated
by the Name of the <i>Fair Maid</i> of <i>Kent</i>, (whom
<i>Edward</i> the Black Prince, afterward married) whereas
no Historian ever gave the least Inuendo that King
<i>Edward</i> III. ever courted her as a Mistress. <i>Selden</i> points
at her when he calls the Lady, from whom the Garter
slipp’d, Countess of <i>Kent</i> and <i>Salisbury</i>: But about the Time
when this Order was founded she in truth was dignified
with neither Honour; for altho’ she was Daughter to <i>Tho.</i>
of <i>Woodstock</i>, Earl of <i>Kent</i>, and had been sometime the reputed
Wife of <i>William Mountague</i>, second Earl of <i>Salisbury</i>,
yet then she cou’d not properly be accounted Countess
of <i>Salisbury</i>. She was actually Wife to Sir <i>Thomas Holland</i>,
(one of the First Founders of the Order.) Nor
was she yet (tho’ afterwards) Countess of Kent, because
her Brother <i>John</i> Earl of <i>Kent</i>, at the Institution of
this Order, survived, and died not till 26 <i>Edw.</i> III.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span><span class='sc'>That</span> there was a Countess of <i>Salisbury</i> with whom
King <i>Edward</i> III. became greatly enamour’d, <i>Froissart</i> reports
after this manner, <i>That this King having relieved a
Castle of that Earl’s in the North, wherein his Countess had
been besieged by the</i> Scots (<i>the Earl himself being at that time
Prisoner in</i> France;) <i>upon sight of her extraordinary Beauty
he fell in love with her; but she so virtuously demeaned her
self, during his Abode there, that he declined further Solicitation</i>.
However, some time after, the King out of Desire
to see her, proclaim’d solemn Justs in <i>London</i>, whither
this Countess and other Ladies being invited, came
up. This Castle it seems was <i>Wark</i> upon <i>Tweed</i> in <i>Northumberland</i>,
which King <i>Edward</i> had formerly bestowed
on her Husband, for his good Service past, when he
first espoused her, being then but a Knight.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Altho’</span> it should be admitted that this Countess of
<i>Salisbury</i> was the King’s Mistress, yet must it be remark’d,
That she was Wife to <i>William Mountague</i>, Kt.
created Earl of <i>Salisbury</i>, <i>Anno</i> 11 <i>Edw.</i> III. Mother to
<i>William</i> the before-mention’d second Earl, that her
Christian Name was <i>Catherine</i>, not <i>Alice</i>, as <i>Froissart</i>, not
<i>Joan</i>, as others call her, Daughter to <i>William</i> Lord
<i>Granston</i>, and that she expired 28 <i>Edw.</i> III. But that the
whole may appear, what indeed it is, a meer Fable, we
shall insert the Judgment of Dr. <i>Heylin</i>, who took great
Pains in this Particular. <i>This</i>, says he, <i>I take to be a vain
and idle Romance, derogatory both to the Founder and the
Order first published by</i> Pol. Virgil, <i>a Stranger to the Affairs
of</i> England, <i>and by him taken upon no better ground than</i>
Fama Vulgi, <i>the Tradition of the common People, too trifling
a Foundation to so great a Building</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Of</span> the same Contexture with the former is another
Tradition in <i>Andrew du Chesne</i>, <i>That the Queen departing
from the King to her own Apartments, and he following soon
after, chanced to espy a Blue Garter lying on the Ground (supposed
to have slipp’d from her Leg) whilst some of his Attendants
carelesly passed by it, as disdaining to stoop at such a
Trifle; but he knowing the Owner, commanded it to be given
him; at the Receipt of which he said, You make but small
account of this Garter; but within few Months, I’ll cause the
best of you all to reverence it alike</i>. Some suppose that the
Motto was the Queen’s Answer, when the King asked
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>her, <i>What Men would conjecture of her, upon her losing her
Garter in such a manner?</i></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Both</span> Relations are far distant from Fact; nevertheless
it has thus far’d with other Orders of Sovereign
Foundation, and an amorous, instead of an honourable
Account, has been falsly render’d of their
Institution; as for Instance, <i>The Order of the</i> Annunciade,
and that of <i>The Golden Fleece</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>There</span> is a third Opinion grounded on a Relation
made of King <i>Rich.</i> I. who, whilst his Forces were
employ’d against <i>Cyprus</i> and <i>Acon</i>, and extremely tir’d
and harrass’d with the Siege, he, by the Assistance and
Mediation of St. <i>George</i> (as imagin’d) was inspir’d with
fresh Courage, and bethought himself of a new Device,
which was to tie about the Legs of a Number of
Knights, a Leathern Thong Garter, for such had he
then at hand, whereby they being emulated to future
Glory, with Assurance of Reward if they prov’d victorious,
they might be excited to behave themselves intrepidly
and well, much after the Examples of the old
<i>Romans</i>, among whom were distributed various Crowns
for several Causes, to adorn the Soldiers: But if King
<i>Richard</i> I. did make use of this Device in the <i>Holy Land</i>,
as a Signal or Mark of Distinction of a Party, upon
some warlike Exploit, yet that he took Occasion to
create a distinct Order of Knighthood thereupon, there
is not sufficient warrant to believe; (for it is only
put down in the Preface of the <i>Black Book</i>, but not
in any Part of the Annals of the Order; nor can it
plead higher Antiquity than the Reign of King <i>Hen.</i>
VIII. when written.) All the Advantage that can be
made of it, is, to heighten the Reputation of that Saint
among the <i>English</i>, by which Means the Garter came
to be dedicated to him, and not that it contributed to
its Institution.</p>

<p class='c008'>§ 2. <span class='sc'>The</span> true Motive was therefore, neither the
Ladies Garter, or King <i>Richard</i>’s Leathern Thong,
that it owes it Original to: But King <i>Edward</i>, being
a Person of consummate Vertue, gave himself up to
military Affairs; and being engag’d in War for recovering
his Right to <i>France</i>, made use of the best Martialists
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>of the Age, did thereupon first design (induc’d
by its ancient Fame) the Restoration of King
<i>Arthur</i>’s <i>Round Table</i>, to invite hither the Gallant Spirits
from abroad, and endear them to himself; and adjudging
no Place more requisite than <i>Windsor</i>, upon
<i>New-Year’s-Day</i>, <i>A. D.</i> 1344. he issu’d out Letters of
Protection for the safe going and return of Foreign
Knights, to try their Valour at the Solemn Justs to be
held there on <i>Monday</i> after the Feast of St. <i>Hilary</i> following
(which happen’d <i>Jan.</i> 19.) And these Letters
of Safe-Conduct continu’d in force until the <i>Octaves</i> of
the Purification of our blessed Virgin ensuing, being
the 18th Year of his Reign. At the Time appointed,
he provided a great Supper to begin the Solemnity,
and then ordain’d this Festival to be annually at <i>Whitsontide</i>;
and immediately after these first Exercises were
over, for a future and better Accommodation, he impress’d
Workmen and Carriages for erecting a particular
Building in the Castle, and therein plac’d a Table
of Two Hundred Foot Diameter, where the Knights
should have their Entertainment of Diet, at his Expence
of 100 <i>l.</i> <i>per</i> Week; to which Building he gave
the Name of <i>The Round Table</i>. And as at these great
Conventions the Days were spent in all Kinds of noble
Feats of Arms, Justs and Turnaments, so were a
great Part of the Nights consum’d in publick Balls
and dancing with the Ladies that attended the Queen
thither; and perhaps it was hence conjectur’d, that at
some of these Balls the Queen’s Garter, or the Garter
of <i>Catherine</i>, Countess of <i>Salisbury</i>, might slip off, and
the King’s taking it up occasion Smiles in the Bystanders;
and afterwards, when the King had modell’d
his intended Order, a Garter offering it self for its
chief Ensign, might add to the Conjecture; but that
it was the principal Cause, is a groundless Imagination.
And tho’ King <i>Edward</i> advanc’d the Honour of the
Garter, as to denominate the Order, yet was it not to
enhance Reputation to, or perpetuate an effeminate
Occasion, but to adorn Martial Prowess, with Honours,
Rewards and Splendor; to increase Vertue and
Valour in the Hearts of his Nobility, that so true
Worth, after long and hazardous Exploits, should not
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>enviously be depriv’d of that Glory which it hath intrinsically
deserv’d, and that active and hardy Youths
might not want a Spur in their Progression in the
Paths of Vertue, which is to be esteem’d glorious and
eternal.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>It</span> is further observable, that the <i>French</i> King, <i>Philip
de Valoys</i>, in Emulation of this Seminary at <i>Windsor</i>,
set up a <i>Round Table</i> at his Court, and invited Knights
and valiant Men of Arms out of <i>Italy</i> and <i>Almaine</i> thither,
lest they should repair to our King <i>Edward</i> III.
which meeting with Success, prov’d a Countermine to
his main Design; who perceiving that his Hospitality
towards strange Knights, upon Account of reviving
King <i>Arthur</i>’s <i>Round Table</i> was too general, nor did sufficiently
ingratiate them to his Person, but being unconstrain’d
and at Liberty, did after their Departure
take what Side they pleas’d in the ensuing Wars, he at
length resolv’d upon a Projection more particular and
select, and such as might oblige those whom he
thought fit to make his Associates, in a lasting Bond of
Friendship and Honour: And having issu’d forth his
own Garter for the Signal of a Battle, that was crown’d
with Success, (which is conceiv’d to be the Battle of
<i>Cressy</i>, fought about Three Years after his erecting the
<i>Round Table</i>;) upon so remarkable a Victory, he thence
took Occasion to institute this Order, and gave the
Garter Preheminence among the Ensigns of it, whence
that select Number, whom he incorporated into a Fraternity,
are styl’d <i>Equites Aureæ Periscelidis</i>, and vulgarly
<i>Knights of the Garter</i>. By this Symbol he design’d to
bind the Knights and Fellows of it mutually unto one
another, and all of them joyntly to himself, as Sovereign
of the Order; nor was his Expectation frustrated,
for it did not serve only as a vehement Spur and
Incentive to Honour and martial Vertue, but also as a
golden Bond of Unity and internal Society; and for
this Consideration <i>Cambden</i> aptly calls it a Badge of
Unity and Concord.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>By</span> the Symbols of this Garter the Knights are reminded,
with all Religiousness, Sincerity, Friendliness,
Faithfulness and Dexterity, not to leave the Pursuit of
whatsoever they take in hand, nor to enterprize any
<span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>Thing contrary to the Statutes of the Order; neither
to frustrate the Rights of Peace and Friendship, nor
vilify the Law of Arms, or proceed in any Thing farther
than Faith and Compact, or the Bond of Friendship
will admit. Moreover, in the binding of the Leg
with this enobled Ensign, there was given this Caveat
and Exhortation, that the Knights should not pusillanimously
(by running away from Battle) betray the
Valour and Renown which is ingrafted in Constancy
and Magnanimity. Nay, so exactly did the Founder
contrive the whole Habit into the Signification of the
Garter, that he ordain’d his and the Knights-Companions
Robes and Ornaments to be all alike, both for
Materials and Fashion, intimating thereby, That they
ought to conserve brotherly Affection among themselves.
The great Collar of the Order was made of
equal Weight, and like Number of Knots and Links,
in Token of the like Bond of Faith, Peace and Amity
inviolably to be observ’d and retain’d amongst them:
In fine, all Things were so design’d, that every one
might plainly perceive how much these Things tended
to the Maintenance of Amity and Concord.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> further reference to the establishing this Order,
the aforesaid King calling together the Earls, Barons,
and principal Knights of his Kingdom, <i>Freely</i>, says
<i>Froissart</i>, <i>and obligingly declar’d his Mind to them concerning
this Affair</i>: To which <i>all of them being well inclin’d, entertain’d
the Motion with equal Joy and Applause, deeming
it would prove a very great Advancement to Piety, Nobility
and Vertue, and likewise an excellent Expedient for the uniting
not only his Subjects one with another, but all Foreigners
conjunctively with them, in the Bonds of Amity and Peace</i>.
And ’tis very improbable the prudent Founder should
summon his Nobles to consult about the Grandeur of
an Order, that had taken its Rise from so slight an
Occasion as the dropping of a Garter from a Lady’s Leg.
Now, to draw the Tye of Friendship more close, the
King caused those who were (or should be) of the
Order, to be call’d <i>Fellows</i>, <i>Associates</i>, <i>Colleagues</i>, <i>Brethren</i>,
and <i>Knights-Companions</i>, and the Order it self a <i>Society</i>,
<i>Fellowship</i>, <i>College of Knights</i>, and <i>Knight-Companionship</i>;
and their Habits to be all alike, to represent how they
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>ought to be united in all Chances and various Turns
of Fortune; Co-partners both in Peace and War, assistant
to one another in all serious and dangerous Exploits;
and thro’ the whole Course of their Lives to
shew Fidelity and Friendliness one towards another.
There are other Reasons assign’d, much to the same
Effect, That the Order was instituted <i>to fortifie the Confidence
of the King, the Kingdom and Martial Vertue</i>; that
is to say, <i>to strengthen the Faith of the Subjects towards
them, and for their greater Security</i>, and <i>because the Garter
carries with it a Bond or Tye of Fellowship, and is a Symbol
of Amity between Princes, being Companions of the same
Order</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> the last Place, if we look upon the Statutes of its
Institution, we shall find the Injunctions wholly Military,
and so are the Words of Admonition pronounc’d
at the putting on the Ensigns of the Order: And the
Ground of the Institution (in the Preamble to King
<i>Henry</i> VIII’s <i>Exemplar</i>) is said to be <i>for the Honour of God
and Exaltation of the Catholick Faith, joyn’d both with Piety
and Charity, in establishing a College of religious Men to pray
for the Prosperity of the Sovereign of the Order and the Knights-Companions,
and to perform other holy Duties</i>; as also <i>ordaining
a Maintenance for a Company of Alms-Knights, who
have not otherwise wherewith to support themselves</i>; but not
one Word relating to the Engagement on behalf of the
feminine Sex.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>And</span> whereas King <i>Edw.</i> III. had laid Claim by his
Title to the Kingdom of <i>France</i>, and in Right thereof
assum’d its Arms, he from the Colour of them, ’tis said,
caus’d the Garter to be made Blue, and the Circumscription
Gold: And it may, without straining, be inferr’d
from the Motto, <i>Honi soit qui mal y pense</i>, that
he retorted Shame and Defiance upon him that should
dare to think amiss of so just an Enterprize, as he
had undertaken for recovering of his lawful Right to
that Crown; and that the Magnanimity and Bravery
of those Knights, whom he had elected into this Order,
was such as would impower and enable them to
maintain the Quarrel against all who thought ill of it.
Consonant to this is the Conjecture of <i>Harpsfield</i>, that
this Apophthegm was design’d to put the Knights-Companions
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>in mind, <i>Not to admit any Thing in their Actions,
or among their Thoughts, derogatory to themselves and their
Honour</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>That</span> Age did exceedingly abound with Impresses,
Motto’s and Devices, and particularly King <i>Edw.</i> III.
was so excessively given up to them, that his Apparel,
Plate, Bed, Houshold-Furniture, Shields, and even the
Harness of his Horses, and the like, were not without
them, many of which now to descant upon would be
a fruitless Attempt, seeing the Occasion of the Invention,
and the Circumstances are lost, that should illustrate
them; and others, by reason of their Brevity,
seem’d insignificant, in regard something was designedly
omitted, and left to be understood, which cannot
now be rightly supply’d, so as to arrive at the Mind of
the Inventor. Of this Number may be this Motto, <i>It
is as it is</i>, which was embroider’d upon a Doublet of
that King; tho’ there are others which seem more easy
to be decypher’d; as that daring Motto wrought upon
his Surcoat and Shield provided to be used at a Turnament,</p>

<p class='c008'>§ 3. <span class='sc'>The</span> Time when the Order was instituted, Historians
differ widely about; <i>Selden</i>, <i>Cowper</i>, and
others, from <i>Froissart</i> (who wrote <i>temp. Rich.</i> II.) would
have it in the 18th of King <i>Edw.</i> III. But since <i>Froissart</i>
errs, in making the Number of Knights-Companions
no fewer than Forty, which is a grand Mistake,
Why might not he trip in Point of Time, and confound
the Year of its Erection, with that wherein the
Founder renew’d the Order of <i>The Round Table</i>, <i>Windsor</i>
being the Place for both. For should we admit,
that during some Part of the Solemnity held in this
King’s 18th Year, when the Accident of the Lady’s
Garter slipping off happen’d, what other Inference can
be made, but that he had only an Intention to put in
Execution somewhat afterwards? Not that an Order
was actually erected at that Time: Besides, the Jollity
of the Season, the Greatness of the Concourse, and
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>the Splendidness of the Festivity, it was too busy a
Time to suffer much Consultation tending thereunto;
or at least to mould and model a Design so compleat
and substantial, as it appears to have been even at first.
If we joyn <i>Fabian</i>, he is plain, that tho’ the King design’d
the Institution at the End of the Festival,
(which he places between <i>Candlemas</i> and <i>Lent</i>, in the
19th, and not 18th Year of that King) <i>Yet was it not
then</i>, saith he, <i>but afterwards establish’d by him</i>. Nevertheless,
Mr. <i>Selden</i> elsewhere observes, it had its Original
in the 24th Year of the said King. And our industrious
<i>Stow</i> (with whom <i>Lily</i>, <i>Speed</i>, and <i>Segar</i> agree)
tells us, <i>That the first Feast of the Order was celebrated</i>
A. D. 1350. which exactly agrees to the 24th of <i>Edward</i>
III. But <i>Polydore Virgil</i> places it after the 25th of
<i>Edward</i> III. We must therefore have recourse to some
other Proofs for elucidating this Point, since this Chronological
<i>Æra</i> of the true Time of its Institution hath
wonderfully slipp’d the Pens of all Writers.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Admitting</span> then that the erecting this Order was
first thought of by King <i>Edward</i>, at some of those
grand Assemblies of <i>The Round Table</i>, held after the
<i>French</i> King had set up the like; yet was it not mature,
or brought to any Perfection, till after his glorious
Victories and Triumphs over the <i>French</i> and <i>Scots</i> in
the Battles of <i>Cressy</i> and <i>Nevil</i>’s Cross, (in the last of
which the <i>Scotch</i> King, <i>David</i>, was taken Prisoner) and
until King <i>Edward</i> had <i>Calais</i> surrendred to him, as will
appear very conspicuous.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Among</span> the Rolls of the Great Wardrobe, is one
containing the Account of all the King’s Liveries, from
<i>Michaelmas Anno</i> 21, to the 31st of <i>Jan.</i> 23 <i>Edw.</i> III.
In the same are divers Things mention’d to be adorn’d
with Garters, which were provided against the first
grand Feast of St. <i>George</i>; and among the rest, the
Royal Robes, <i>viz.</i> his Mantle, Surcoat and Hood;
likewise a Bed of Blue Taffaty was bedeck’d with Garters,
containing the Motto, <i>Honi soit qui mal y pense</i>.
There were made for the Sovereign Three Harnesses,
whereof Two were of White Velvet, wrought over
with Garters <i>de blu &amp; diaspris per totum compedmein cum
Woodhouses</i>; and the Third <i>de Velvetto Ynde cont. Lappekin
<span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>quisseux &amp; caligas</i>, wrought over likewise with
Garters. Had the Roll been divided into Years, or
had distinguishing Marks of Time upon it, we might
have been guided with more Certainty as to the true
Year of the Institution. However, we may thence
conclude it was not founded in the 18th of <i>Edw.</i> III.
because that the Sovereign’s Robes were not made
until the 22d Year of his Reign at soonest; perhaps
not till the Beginning of the 23d. But to put the
Matter beyond dispute, the Founder’s Statutes fix the
Time of Institution to his 23d Year; so do the Statutes
of King <i>Henry</i> V. and the Preface to the <i>Black Book</i>,
<i>Leland</i>, <i>Mills</i> and Dr. <i>Heylin</i>. To conclude, when he
had fix’d upon the Day and Place for celebrating the
first grand Feast of this Order, he sent his Heralds into
<i>Germany</i>, <i>France</i>, <i>Scotland</i>, <i>Burgundy</i>, <i>Hainault</i>, <i>Flanders</i>
and <i>Brabant</i>, to invite all Knights and Esquires, (with
Assurance of Safe-Conduct and Liberty for Fifteen
Days, both before and after the grand Solemnity) to
shew their military Prowess and other publick Exercises
there to be perform’d, proper to the Place and
Occasion; agreeable to which Invitation, sundry
Knights and Gallant Men came over to signalize their
Valour; and what made the Solemnity more glorious,
King <i>Edward</i>’s Queen was there present, attended with
Three Hundred of the fairest Ladies, in all imaginable
Splendor and Gaity.</p>

<p class='c008'>§ 4. <span class='sc'>The</span> Patrons of the Order were several, under
whose Protection (according to the Custom of the Age)
King <i>Edw.</i> III. put himself and all the Knights-Companions,
that the Affairs of the Order might be defended,
preserved and govern’d.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> <i>first</i> and chiefest which he elected, was the
<i>Holy Trinity</i>, which in a more especial Manner was invocated
to the Aid and Assistance of this Order.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Secondly</i>, King <i>Edward</i> III. intitled peculiarly the
<i>blessed Virgin</i> Mary, accounted then the general Mediatrix
and Protectress of all Men; unto whom King <i>Edward</i>
IV. was so strictly devoted, that he thought some
additional Ceremonies requisite to her farther Honour,
and thereupon ordain’d, that on her Five Solemnities
<span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span>the Knights Companions should annually (as accustom’d
on the Feast of St. <i>George</i>) wear the Habit of
the Order as long as Divine Service was celebrating,
(unless they had sufficient Cause of excuse) bearing on
the right Shoulders of their Robes a golden Figure of
the Virgin <i>Mary</i>; and that they should go in the same
Manner and Habit upon all <i>Sundays</i> throughout the
Year; and lastly, that on the same Days for ever they
should say Five <i>Pater Nosters</i>, with as many <i>Ave Maria’s</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Thirdly</i>, St. <i>George</i> of <i>Cappadocia</i>, a most choice Champion
of Christ and famous Martyr, was also elected
one of the Patrons to this Order by King <i>Edward</i> III.
not so much as he was a Professor of the Christian Faith,
or for that he was an armed Soldier or Knight of
Christ, but so much the more because in those Wars,
which were waged by the Christians against the Infidels,
he by several Appearances manifested his Presence
as a most certain Encourager and Assistant to the
Christians; the Relations whereof may be seen in Dr.
<i>Heylin</i>’s History, who hath laboriously and judiciously
maintain’d the History of this Saint, against those that
will not allow him a Place in Heaven, or a Being in
the Church. In like manner the learned <i>Selden</i> hath
avouch’d him to be the special Patron, Protector, Defender,
and Advocate of this Realm of <i>England</i>; and
has made it plainly appear in what Veneration he hath
been honour’d abroad, especially among the Eastern
Nations. To whose corroborating Testimonies we
shall add, That this Title of Patron to our Nation, as
given to St. <i>George</i> by the Founder of this Order, in a
Patent granted to the Dean and Canons of the Chapel
of St. <i>Stephen</i> at <i>Westminster</i>, and St. <i>George</i> at <i>Windsor</i>,
which dischargeth them from Payment of Tythes; as
also by King <i>Henry</i> VIII. in the Preamble of his Statutes.
And tho’ in general he is styl’d the Principal
Patron of the Affairs of <i>Christendom</i>, and a tutelar Guardian
of military Men, yet among all Christians the
<i>English</i> did excel; and in this Nation the Founder of
this Order, in making choice of such an approv’d expert
Captain and Patron, in particular Respect of
whom the Knights had the Title of <i>Equites Georgiani</i>,
St. <i>George</i>’s Knights, and the Order it self came to be
<span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span>call’d the <i>Ordo Divi Sancti Georgii</i>, The Order of St.
<i>George</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>It</span> is remarkable, that <i>Du Chesne</i>, a noted <i>French</i> Historian,
acknowledges it was by the special Invocation
of St. <i>George</i> that King <i>Edward</i> III. gain’d the Battle of
<i>Cressy</i>, which afterwards bringing to his Remembrance,
<i>He founded</i>, says he, <i>a Chapel within the Castle of</i> Windsor.
But if we may ascend a step higher, and give
credit to <i>Harding</i>, it’s recorded King <i>Arthur</i> paid St.
<i>George</i> particular Honours, for he advanc’d his Picture
in one of his Banners, which was about Two Hundred
Years after his Martyrdom, and very early for a Country
so remote from <i>Cappadocia</i> to have him in Reverence
and Esteem.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Lastly</i>, The Founder added a fourth Patron, whose
Name himself bore, <i>viz.</i> St. <i>Edward the Confessor</i>, his
Predecessor, King of <i>England</i>; and we find he was
wont to be invocated by this Founder, as well as St.
<i>George</i>, in any great Difficulties and Streights. <i>Walsingham</i>
gives an Instance at the Skirmish of <i>Calais</i>, <i>A. D.</i>
1349. when King <i>Edward</i>, in great Anger and Grief,
drew out his Sword, and most passionately cry’d out,
<i>Ha St.</i> Edward, <i>Ha St.</i> George; which his Soldiers
hearing, ran presently to him, and rushing violently
upon the Enemy, put many of them to the Sword.
These Four Patrons we find recorded together in the
Preamble of the Foundation of <i>Windsor</i> College by
King <i>Edward</i> III. tho’ in the Preamble to his Statutes
of the Order, and to King <i>Henry</i> V’s Statutes, St. <i>Edward
the Confessor</i> is omitted; nevertheless he is enumerated
with the rest in the Preamble to King <i>Henry</i> VIII’s.</p>

<p class='c008'>§ 5. <span class='sc'>As</span> to the Honour and Reputation of this Noble
Order, either in Comparison with others, or in Reference
to it self, it challenges the Precedency of Antiquity,
before the eldest Rank of Honour of that Kind
any where establish’d.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Secondly</i>, The Statutes of the Foundation were so exquisitely
and judiciously devised and compacted, upon
such solid Foundations of Honour and Nobleness, that
they afterwards became a Precedent to other Orders;
and gave the Plan to those Two of <i>The Golden Fleece</i> and
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>of Monsieur St. <i>Michael</i>, as is manifest by comparing their
Statutes.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Thirdly</i>, It is no small Honour that accrues to this
Order, that the Number of these Knights-Companions
were never encreas’d, but as they were Twenty Six
with the Sovereign, so they now thus continue, <i>ut
Pretium faciat raritas</i>; for the infringing this Article
hath split several other military Orders into Contempt
and Ruin, as nothing more tarnishing, or throwing a
sully on the Worth of Glory and Honour, than when
render’d so vulgar, and indifferently disposed without
Distinction and Merit, as is exemplify’d in <i>The Order
of the</i> Star, and the now declining <i>Order of St.</i> Michael.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Fourthly</i>, It has receiv’d more additional Lustre by
being honour’d with the Companionship of divers Emperors,
Kings and Sovereign Princes, who esteem’d it
the Summit of their Glory, and the highest Trophy of
additional Honour, to be enroll’d in the Number. Insomuch
that some of them with Impatience courted the
Election. For we find recorded in the Register, <i>A. D.</i>
1672. Eight Emperors of <i>Germany</i>, Three Kings of
<i>Spain</i>, Five <i>French</i> Kings, Two Kings of <i>Scotland</i>, Five
Kings of <i>Denmark</i>, Five Kings of <i>Portugal</i>, Two Kings
of <i>Sweden</i>, One King of <i>Poland</i>, One King of <i>Arragon</i>,
Two Kings of <i>Naples</i>, besides divers Dukes and other
free Princes; as One Duke of <i>Guelderland</i>, One Duke of
<i>Holland</i>, Two Dukes of <i>Burgundy</i>, Two Dukes of <i>Brunswick</i>,
One Duke of <i>Milan</i>, Two Dukes of <i>Urbin</i>, One
Duke of <i>Ferrara</i>, One Duke of <i>Savoy</i>, Two Dukes of
<i>Holstein</i>, One Duke of <i>Saxony</i>, and One Duke of <i>Wertemberg</i>,
Seven Count Palatines of the <i>Rhine</i>, Four Princes
of <i>Orange</i>, and One Marquis of <i>Brandenburg</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Fifthly</i>, It entitles those Knights and Noblemen, whose
Vertue hath rais’d them to this Pitch of Greatness, to
be Companions and Associates with Emperors and
Kings, a Prerogative of an high Nature, and a sufficient
Recompence for the greatest Merit. We shall close
up all with the high Elogy bestow’d on it by the learned
<i>Selden</i>, <i>That it exceeds in Majesty, Honour and Fame, all
Chivalrous Orders of the World</i>.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c007'><span class='sc'>Order</span> and Regularity is not only the Beauty
and Symmetry of Government and Societies, but
also greatly contributes to their Establishment
and Perpetuity. Statutes and Rules are as well the
Bounds to determine, as Bonds to unite Fellowship
and Societies together; and if either fall into disuse,
or be unadvisedly broken, they open a Field to Dissolution
and Ruin.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Such</span> like Considerations mov’d and excited the victorious
King <i>Edward</i> III. (after he had determin’d the
Erection of this most renown’d <i>Order of the Garter</i>) to
<i>devise and institute several laudable Statutes and Ordinances,
to be duly observ’d and kept within the said Order</i>; which
being collected into one Body, are call’d <i>The Statutes of
Institution</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Original of these was ordain’d to be kept within
the Treasury of the College of <i>Windsor</i>, but hath
long since wholly perish’d; yet a Transcript of them
is recorded in the Reign of King <i>Henry</i> V. in an old
Book call’d <i>Registrum Ordinis Chartaceum</i>. Two more
ancient <i>Exemplars</i> of this Body of Statutes are also in
being; the one in the Library of the Lord <i>Hatton</i>,
and the other in the <i>Black Book</i> of the Order; and
comparing them together, I shall here give from the
<i>Latin</i> the Heads they consist of.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. <span class='sc'>The</span> King of <i>England</i>, his Heirs and Successors,
are to be Sovereigns or Superiors of this Order.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. <span class='sc'>None</span> are to be admitted, unless he be a Gentleman
of Blood, and that he be a Knight and without
Reproach.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. <span class='sc'>The</span> Knights-Companions were to be Twenty
Six, each to have at <i>Windsor</i> a Mantle and Garter for
the better Splendor of the Order; to wear the said
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>Habit whensoever they go to the Chapel of St. <i>George</i>
or Chapter-House, to hold a Chapter, or do any thing
relating to their Order. In like manner they are to
wear the Habit upon the Vigils of St. <i>George</i>, in their
Procession from the King’s Lodgings to the Chapel or
Chapter-House, and returning back, and during Supper,
continue so habited till it be over, and likewise on
the Morrow of St. <i>George</i>’s Day, at Chapel, Dinner-time,
Supper-time, and afterwards all the said Day, until the
Sovereign or his Deputy shall deposite the Ensigns of
the Order, and decree their Departure.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. <span class='sc'>There</span> were to be Thirteen Canons Secular, who
at the Time of their Institution, or within a Year, were
to be Priests, and as many Vicars already Priests, or to be
made so at the next Ordination, answerable to the
number of the Knights-Companions; these religious
Persons to be presented by the several Founders each
one, and upon the Death or Vacancy of such presented,
the Sovereign of the Order ever afterwards to have the
Nomination of them, who were bound to pray for
the good Estate of the Sovereign and his Kingdom,
and particularly for this Order.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. <span class='sc'>The</span> Canons were to wear a Purple Mantle, with
the Arms of St. <i>George</i> in a Roundle upon their right
Shoulder.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. <span class='sc'>There</span> were to be Twenty Six poor veterane
Knights, each to have a competent Subsistence, their
Election to be after the manner of the Canons aforesaid.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. <span class='sc'>These</span> Knights were to have a Red Mantle, with
the Arms of St. <i>George</i>; but without any Circle of the
Garter about it.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. <span class='sc'>If</span> the Sovereign could not be present at the solemn
Festival of St. <i>George</i>, his Deputy was to supply his
Place at the Charge of the Sovereign; but such Deputy
was not to make any new Ordinances, tho’ he has
License to correct or amend the old Ones.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. <span class='sc'>Every</span> Year, upon the Vigils of St. <i>George</i>, the
Knights-Companions within the Realm, or elsewhere,
if conveniently, are to assemble, at <i>Windsor</i> Castle, and
be present there at the Celebration of Divine Service,
in the Habit of the Order, where placed regularly in
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>their Stalls or Seats, directly over their Heads their
Helmets and Swords, <i>&amp;c.</i> are to be hung up, and remain
as long as such Knights live, in Honour of them,
and to signify the Defence of the Church, to which
they are obliged as a Military Order; but in case the
Feast of St. <i>George</i> happens to fall within the Quindene
or Fifteen Days after the Feast of <i>Easter</i>, then it
was to be prorogued to the <i>Sunday</i> next following, accounting
Fifteen Days from <i>Easter</i> Day, that every
Knight-Companion might have reasonable time to come,
nor be forced to ride upon any of the Three <i>Easter</i>
Holy-days.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. <span class='sc'>That</span> they meet in St. <i>George</i>’s Chapel yearly, on
the Eve of St. <i>George</i>, at the Hour of Three in the Afternoon;
and if they come not at the Time assigned,
without a just Excuse, which the Sovereign or his Deputy
allows, their Penalty is to be according to the
Ordinance of the Chapter; which is, That they shall
not enter into the Chapter Door for that time, but stay
without, and shall have no Voice in any thing that is
done in the said Chapter; and if they come not before
the Beginning of Vespers, they shall not enter into
their Stalls, but shall tarry below before the said
Stalls in the Choiristers Places during Vespers. The like
Penalty is ordain’d for not coming to the Mass or Morning-Service
betime, and at Vespers, on St. <i>George</i>’s Day;
and whosoever shall absent himself wholly from this
Solemnity, without sufficient Excuse and Leave from
the Sovereign or Deputy, he is not to enter within his
Stall the next Feast after, but shall stay below, and before
his Stall, as it is said at Vespers, and in the Morrows
Procession must walk before the Three processional
Crosses, [now the Choiristers,] and at Mass [Service]
shall sit below until the Offering, and he to
offer last. After which he is to come before the Sovereign,
or his Deputy’s Stall, and ask Pardon, which
re-instates him in his Stall. Absenting the next second
Time upon the Feast, without Leave, he has no Stall

<p class='c000'>14. <span class='sc'>In</span> the Morrow after the Solemnity of St. <i>George</i>’s
Feast is over, before their separating, a Mass <i>de Requie</i>
or Office <i>de Defunctis</i> was to be used, at which the
Knights-Companions were all entirely to be present,
without necessary Impediment shown to the Sovereign
or Deputy for Liberty to depart.</p>

<p class='c000'>15. <span class='sc'>They</span> were to leave their Robes at <i>Windsor</i> always,
to be ready for them there upon any sudden Occasions
that might evene.</p>

<p class='c000'>16. <span class='sc'>Journying</span> near <i>Windsor</i>, in Honour of the Place,
unless lawful Cause obstructs, they must take it in their
Way, and assuming the Habit of the Order the Canons
wore, devoutly to meet and conduct them into the
Chapel; where, if it happens to be time of Divine
Service, they are to hear the same; if not, they are
to be detained no longer than while the Canons shall
say the Psalm <i>de profundis</i> for the Defunct, and during
their own Offering: But if any had riden thro’ the
Town, without visiting the Chapel and offering there,
for every Neglect he must go one Mile on Foot from
the said Chapel, to shew his Obedience, and offer an
Half-Penny in Honour of St. <i>George</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>17. <span class='sc'>Upon</span> first Notice of the Death of any of the Order,
the Sovereign shall ordain a Thousand Masses,
every Foreign Prince shall cause Eight Hundred, a
Prince of Wales Seven Hundred, a Duke Six Hundred,
an Earl Three Hundred, every Baron Two
Hundred, and every Knight Batchellor One Hundred
Masses to be celebrated for the Good of the Soul departed;
<span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>which neglected for a Quarter of a Year after
notice of such Death, the Masses are to be doubled;
upon half a Year’s Neglect, again doubled; and so from
Time to Time in like Form till the End of the Year,
and then the Year’s to be doubled.</p>

<p class='c000'>18. <span class='sc'>Upon</span> sure Notice of the Death of a Knight-Companion,
the Sovereign, or his Deputy, is to converse
by Letters, the Remainder [not Strangers] that
are within the Kingdom, to meet him within Six Weeks
in some convenient Place, and elect another; which assembled,
at least Six, with the Sovereign or Deputy, every
of them present is to name Nine of the worthiest
and sufficientest Knights without Reproof that he
knows, whether native Subjects or Foreigners, sobeit
they hold no contrary Party, or be against the Sovereign,
<i>viz.</i> Three Earls, or of sublimer Title; Three
Barons, and Three Knights Batchellors, which Names
the Bishop of <i>Windsor</i>, for the Time being, was to
write, or, in his Absence, the Dean or Register, and,
in their Absence, the oldest Residencer in the College,
and after shew them to the Sovereign, who is to chuse
out of them him that has the most Voices, and whom
he esteems the most beneficial to the Crown and Kingdom.
Every Knight failing to appear at an Election,
without an approved Cause, was to pay to the Custos
and College the Penalty of a Mark, and at his next
coming to the Chapter shall kneel upon the Ground, in
the midst of the Chapter, before the Sovereign or Deputy,
until Reconciliation.</p>

<p class='c000'>19. <span class='sc'>Soon</span> after Election, the Knight-Companion elect
is to have a Garter, in token of his Election, and that
he is a Fellow of the Order; and as soon as decreed to
take Possession of his Stall, but not before, is to have
a Mantle, which, if he dies before he receiv’d, he was
not to be accounted as one of the Order, because he
wanted Possession; nevertheless he was to have one
half of the Masses abovesaid, because he had the Garter
deliver’d to him and nothing beside. If he was not
installed within a Year after his receiving the Garter,
and especially if within the Realm, and without reasonable
Excuse to be allowed of by the Sovereign or
Deputy, his Election became void, and they might proceed
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>to a new one: Moreover, neither the Sword nor
Helmet was to be put upon his Stall within the Castle,
before his coming; to the End, that if the Knight elect
came not, his Atchievements might not be unhandsomly
taken down and abused, but honourably removed into
the Choir for the publick Use and Profit of the said
College.</p>

<p class='c000'>20. <span class='sc'>Every</span> Foreigner elected was to have Certification
of such his Election from the Sovereign, at the
Sovereign’s Charge, who was to send him the Garter
and the Mantle, and a Copy of the Statutes of the Order,
under the Common Seal of the said Order, within
Four Months after the Election, the better for him to
advise on; which being accepted, of whatsoever Condition
he be, he was obliged within Eight Months after
to send a sufficient Proxy, according to his State and
Dignity, a Knight irreprehensible to be installed in his
Room, and who was to bring with him a Silk Mantle
of the Blue Colour of the Order, also a Sword and
Helmet to remain at <i>Windsor</i>, which Mantle was be put
upon the right Shoulder of the Proxy, by the Sovereign
or Deputy at the time of Installment, when he is
introduced to take the Stall in the Name of his Lord
and Master; neither was he to deposite the same till the
End of Divine Service; after which he was not to wear
it, nor be admitted in the Chapter-House, or have any
Suffrage, by virtue of any Powers vested in him; but
this Favour Foreigners elected by Proxy were to have,
that could not personally come themselves, they were
to be Partakers of the whole Masses and Orisons of the
Order; whereas, if they died before the Installation,
they were to have but a Moity of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>21. <span class='sc'>Upon</span> the Death of any Earl, [or of Superior
Dignity] Baron, or Knight Batchellor, his Successor,
whether Earl, [or of Superior Dignity] Baron, or
Knight, was to have a vacant Stall of his Predecessor,
without any changing of Places, except the Prince of
<i>Wales</i> alone, who was to have always the next Stall,
and opposite to the Sovereign; so that it may happen for
a Knight to have an Earl’s Place, or an Earl a Knight’s
Place; and this because the first Founders might be
known.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>22. <span class='sc'>Every</span> Knight-Companion at his first Entrance,
was to give a certain Alms, according to their Eminence
and Degree, for the perpetual Maintenance of the Canons
and Poor Knights, <i>viz.</i> the Sovereign Forty Marks,
a Foreign King Twenty Pounds, a Prince of <i>Wales</i>
Twenty Marks, a Duke Ten Pounds, an Earl Ten
Marks, a Baron a Hundred Shillings, and a Knight
Batchellor Five Marks, that by these pious Donations
they might justly entitle themselves to the Name and
Privileges of the Order; wherefore, before these Payments
were rightly performed, their Sword and Helmet
[Atchievements] were not to be hung up, and for Foreigners
the Sovereign was obliged to pay himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>23. <span class='sc'>Upon</span> the Death of any of the Founders his
Arms, in a Plate of Metal, was to be fixed upon the
Back of his Stall, and their Successors were to have the
like, but to be placed underneath their Predecessors,
and not to be so great as those of the first Founders.</p>

<p class='c000'>24. <span class='sc'>At</span> Admission every Knight-Companion must
promise and swear personally, or by Proxy, faithfully
to observe the Statutes of the Order, and none are to
be installed by Proxy but Foreigners only, which cannot
conveniently come in Person.</p>

<p class='c000'>25. <span class='sc'>If</span> the Sovereign be out of <i>England</i> at the Installation
of any Knight-Companion, or could not attend
himself to do what appertains to him in that Point, he
might impower and authorize any of the Fellows to officiate
for him.</p>

<p class='c000'>26. <span class='sc'>That</span> there be a Common Seal or Signet Keeper,
whom the Sovereign was to assign.</p>

<p class='c000'>27. <span class='sc'>Every</span> Knight-Companion was to have a Copy
of the Statutes under the Seal of the Order, the Original
sealed likewise with the said Seal, to remain for
evermore within the Treasury of the College, and upon
the Death of any Knight-Companion, his Executors
were to send back such Copy to be deliver’d to the Custos
or Warden.</p>

<p class='c000'>28. <span class='sc'>No</span> Knight-Companion was to go out of the
Realm and Dominion of <i>England</i>, without the Knowledge
and Licence of the Sovereign, who of Grace and
Favour is bound to grant it upon a Military Expedition,
or other notable Act appertaining to the Honour of
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>Knighthood, in Preference and Advancement of this
Order of St. <i>George</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>29. <span class='sc'>They</span> were not to arm themselves against each
other, but in the Wars of their Sovereign Lord, in his
right and just Quarrel; and if it happen’d that any of
the Order should be retain’d in the Cause and Quarrel
of any Lord, and the adverse Party desir’d another
Knight-Companion on his Side, that latter Knight is by
no means to agree but to excuse himself in all Things,
because his Fellow was armed on the other Side, and
was retain’d before him. And every Knight was bound
to except and agree, at his being retain’d, that he may
have his Discharge from the Wars, upon any of the
Order’s being engaged in Arms before him for the contrary
Party; and if the second retained knows not of it,
upon notice that any of his Fellows were retained before
him, and armed on the contrary Side, the second
retained Knight was to excuse himself to his Master, and
relinquish the Quarrel.</p>

<p class='c000'>30. <span class='sc'>All</span> Licences given to the Knight-Companions
to travel in quest of Honour by Military Exploits; also
all Certificates, mandatous Letters, Certificates, and other
Writings whatsoever relating to the Order, were
to be issued out by the Sovereign, under the Seal of the
Order, to remain in the keeping of one of the Order,
during the Sovereign’s Pleasure. And if the Keeper of
the Seal absent himself upon reasonable Cause, he was
to leave the Seal with another of the Fellowship
that the Sovereign should appoint, to the Intent that
the Seal at no time be out of the Presence of the Sovereign,
he being within his Dominion. And in like
manner concerning the Seal in the Absence of the Sovereign
or the Deputy.</p>

<p class='c000'>31. <span class='sc'>If</span> any Knight-Companion for Devotion sake
should desire to dwell at <i>Windsor</i>, he was to maintain
himself at his own, and not at the College Charge.</p>

<p class='c000'>32. <span class='sc'>Any</span> other Knight, not of the Order, upon the
Account of Devotion, that would reside there, was to
be provided for at the Appointment of the Sovereign,
and the Fellowship also. Any Knight or other Person
giving 10 <i>l.</i> yearly Rents or Lands, or more, to the
College, to participate of their Prayers and Suffrages,
<span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>he was to be registred in the Calendar of Benefactors,
and continually be pray’d for by the Canons and Poor
Knights.</p>

<p class='c000'>33. <span class='sc'>Upon</span> the Death of any Canon, the Custos or
Warden is to certify the same by Letters to the Sovereign,
if beyond Sea, to know whom he pleases to present
to the Canonship.</p>

<p class='c000'>34. <span class='sc'>There</span> was to be a Register appointed by the
Sovereign and Fellowship, the most intelligent Person of
the College, who was to be present at the Chapters, to
record their Elections and the Electors, their Punishments,
and Causes of them, with their Reconciliations,
all Acts whatsoever administred in their Council, from
Chapter to Chapter yearly; for the faithful Execution
of which Office he was to be sworn at his Admission
therein; and whatsoever had been register’d was in
the Beginning of the following Chapter, on the Vigils
of St. <i>George</i>, to be publickly recited before the Sovereign
and the whole Fellowship, that what was amiss and
incorrect might be mended and reduced to due
Form.</p>

<p class='c008'>§ 2. <span class='sc'>Besides</span> these Statutes there are Two other
Bodies, or Exemplars establish’d since, the one by King
<i>Henry</i> V. the other by King <i>Hen.</i> VIII. King <i>Henry</i> V.
finding the Glory of the Order declining, removed the
Grand Festival and other Solemnities, and commanded
a strict Observation of all the Founder’s Statutes, and

which Purpose, on St. <i>George</i>’s Day, <i>Anno</i> 9 <i>Regni sui</i>
he summoned all the Knights-Companions to convene
next Year at the Time of the Solemnity, about the Abrogation
of what tended to darken the Honour of this
Order (if any such were), and for the Advancement of
what might promote the Grandeur and Lustre of it. But
these Resolves came to no Perfection till <i>May</i> 28.

with all magnificent Ceremony imaginable, for being

to a successful Period, by the Advice and Consent of
the Society assembled: That done, all present entreated
the Sovereign, kneeling, that where any of them had
been peccant against the Order, he would please to remit,
and issue out a general Pardon, which he granted
and ratify’d in Chapter next Day. This was a Task of
Three Years compleat before it rose to Perfection, <i>viz.

<p class='c008'>§ 3. <span class='sc'>There</span> have been several Endeavours since the
Reign of King <i>Henry</i> VIII. for reforming the Statutes.
As first, King <i>Edward</i> VI. who as Sovereign, by the
Orders themselves, had an undoubted Prerogative set
him to alter and reform many Things which seem’d
inconsistent with the Religion he establish’d. To
which Purpose, at a Chapter at <i>Greenwich</i>, held <i>April</i> 23.
in the Third Year of his Reign, the Lord <i>St. John</i>, the
Earl of <i>Arundel</i>, and Sir <i>William Paget</i>, were to peruse
and make them agreeable to the King’s other Proceedings,
by the Assistance and Advice of the Protector, the
Duke of <i>Somerset</i>, and other Companions. This was
follow’d by a subsequent Order pass’d in the Chapter
at <i>Greenwich</i> the Year after, that the Statutes should be
reform’d and corrected as they thought expedient:
And for the better Accomplishment of their Design, at
the next Feast, <i>April</i> 24. 5 <i>Edw.</i> VI. another Order
commenc’d, impowering the Duke of <i>Somerset</i>, the Marquess
of <i>Northampton</i>, the Earls of <i>Warwick</i>, <i>Arundel</i>,
<i>Bedford</i> and <i>Wilts</i>, to peruse and amend the Statutes
and other Books of the Order, which were brought to
some tolerable Degree of Perfection; for thereupon a
new Body was collected (in general very much altering
the Laws of the Order) and publish’d <i>March</i> 17.
<i>Anno</i> 7 <i>Edw.</i> VI. But this King within Four Months
after expiring, Queen <i>Mary</i>, his Sister and Successor,
the very first Thing she transacted was to abrogate and
make them void; wherefore we need not mention
them, as never in use and unrevived. For the Execution
of which Purpose, she conven’d a Chapter at St.
<i>James</i>’s, the 27th of <i>September</i> following; and it was
then decreed, that the said Laws and Ordinances, as
inconvenient, impertinent, and tending to Novelty,
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>should be disannulled, and no Account to be made of
them for the future; and for the quicker Execution, Sir
<i>William Petre</i> (that Day admitted Chancellor) had Orders
to see them speedily expung’d out of the Book of
Statutes, and forthwith defac’d, lest any Memory of
them should remain to Posterity; and only those of
her Father, <i>Hen.</i> VIII. and his Royal Predecessors, should
be retain’d.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> this Affair King <i>Philip</i>, her Husband, appear’d no
less zealous; for on the 5th of <i>August</i>, 1 and 2 <i>Philip</i>
and <i>Mary</i>, (which was the 3d Day after he had been
invested with the Habit) himself being present at a
Chapter at <i>Windsor</i>, it was ordain’d, That all Acts and
Decrees in the Great Book, [<i>i. e.</i> the <i>Black Book</i> aforesaid]
which were repugnant and disagreeable, either
with the ancient and receiv’d Statutes of the Order, or
else with the Laws of the Realm, should clearly be
abolish’d and erased, by the Marquis of <i>Winchester</i>, the
Earls of <i>Arundel</i>, <i>Pembroke</i>, and the Lord <i>Paget</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>No</span> sooner was Queen <i>Elizabeth</i> fix’d on the Throne,
but soon after, <i>viz.</i> on St. <i>George</i>’s Day, in the second
Year of her Reign, a View of the Statutes was committed,
by Commission, to Four of the Knights-Companions,
<i>viz</i>. the Marquis of <i>Northampton</i>, the Earls of
<i>Arundel</i> and <i>Pembroke</i>, and the Lord <i>Howard</i> of <i>Effingham</i>,
who were thereby impower’d to peruse and consider
those Statutes with the utmost Care and regard,
if any of them were repugnant to the Religion, Laws
and Statutes of the Realm; and if any such were recorded,
to represent them faithfully to the Sovereign,
that she, in Conjunction with the Knights-Companions,
might establish such Decrees concerning them as she
should think fit; but that any thing was done in pursuance
hereunto, doth not appear; for the Transcripts
of her Father’s Body of the Statutes, throughout the
Time of her Reign, were presented to the Knights-Companions
at their Installations; and the Practice of
her Time was pursuant to the Direction therein, except
in some few Things now and then added or alter’d at
future Chapters, when there arose fresh Matters for
such Expedients.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span><span class='sc'>King</span> <i>James</i> I. her Successor, revolv’d something towards
a new Regulation; and in order to put it in
Execution, the 14th of <i>May</i>, in the 9th Year of his
Reign, decreed, That Commissionary Letters should
be granted to the Earls of <i>Nottingham</i>, <i>Worcester</i>, <i>Pembroke</i>
and <i>Northampton</i>, to empower them to examine
the Registers and other Monuments which pertained
to that Order; and where any Passage should be found
obsolete or obscure, to make it conspicuous and clear;
where Contrariety appear’d, fitly to reconcile it; yet
with no Design of innovating any Thing, but an Intention
of renewing all, as near as might be, to the first
Standard and most ancient Institution of the Order;
saving always Power to himself, as Sovereign of the
Order, to add or diminish any Matter (according to
the Occasion) as it should seem agreeable to his Prudence
for the Honour of this Most Noble Order.
What Progress they made in this Commission, the
Memoirs of that Time are silent in; but some few
Years after, this Affair was reviv’d, and another was
issu’d forth, to the Earls of <i>Nottingham</i>, <i>Worcester</i>, <i>Southampton</i>,
<i>Arundel</i> and <i>Montgomery</i>, and the Viscount <i>Lisle</i>,
all Knights-Companions, dated <i>April</i> 26. in the 16th
Year of his Reign; which Six, or any Four of them,
were thereby constituted to take an exact Survey of all
the ancient Statutes and Articles of the said Order; and
authoriz’d to call before them all such Persons, whether
Officers of the said Order, or others, as could
give any Light or Information concerning that Affair;
and after a serious Deliberation, to pen down what in
them they conceiv’d meet to be explain’d, and what to
be added, whereby to render the Order more illustrious,
that the same being presented to the Sovereign
and the Society, at a Chapter holden, might be resolv’d
on in part, or in all, to be put in Execution, if it
seem’d so good to that King.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>This</span> Affair mov’d very slowly; but towards the
latter End of his Reign, the Earls of <i>Worcester</i>, <i>Montgomery</i>,
<i>Arundel</i>, <i>Surry</i> and <i>Leicester</i>, Five of the Six
Commissioners above-nam’d, having held divers Conferences,
and debated several Matters represented to
them, and at a Chapter convened at <i>Whitehall</i> the 19th
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>of <i>May</i>, <i>Anno</i> 20 <i>Jac.</i> I. did present to the Sovereign
certain Articles, subscribed with their Hands, which,
for the Honour of the Order, they thought requisite
to be duly observ’d.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>By</span> the first of which they made Provision for a further
Progression and Advancement of the illustrious Institution,
in proposing, that every Year a Commission
from the Sovereign should be granted, or continu’d to
such Knights of the Order as the Chapter should pitch
on, to deliberate and weigh all Affairs that fell under
the Order, and that the Year after, an Estimate, by the
Knights in Chapter, should be exhibited, of their Resolutions
and Proceedings by Virtue of the said Commission.
This, with Eight other Articles, were confirm’d
by the Sovereign and Twelve of the Knights-Companions,
the 22d of <i>May</i> following, in a Chapter
held at <i>Whitehall</i>; and so prosperously their Endeavours
succeeded, that on the Feast-day of St. <i>George</i>, at <i>Windsor</i>
in the ensuing Year, the Earl of <i>Worcester</i>, (being then
the Sovereign-Deputy) with Ten Knights-Companions
more, gave their assent to Eight other Articles (most
of them concerning the Alms-Knights) which the
Morning after had the Approbation of the Sovereign;
and before the Celebration of Divine Service, by his
Deputy and Companions assembled in the Chapter-House,
the Observation thereof was duly decreed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>King</span> <i>Charles</i> I. design’d and endeavour’d the most
compleat and absolute Reformation of any of his Predecessors;
and at the Solemnity of St. <i>George</i>, held at
<i>Windsor</i> the 6th of <i>October</i>, in the 6th Year of his Reign,
He commission’d Nine Knights-Companions, <i>viz.</i> the
Earls of <i>Mulgrave</i>, <i>Pembroke</i>, <i>Montgomery</i>, <i>Arundel</i>, <i>Surry</i>,
<i>Salisbury</i>, <i>Carlisle</i>, <i>Dorset</i>, <i>Holland</i>, <i>Berkshire</i> and <i>Suffolk</i>,
with command to assemble Four Times in a Year, to
take into their Consideration the Affairs of the Order;
all which, but the Earls of <i>Mulgrave</i> and <i>Dorset</i>, met at
<i>Whitehall</i> the 2d of <i>January</i> following, where some few
Matters fell under their Consultation. This Commission
was seconded by one of a larger extent about
Three Months after, and directed to the said Knights-Companions,
or to any Eight, Seven, Six, Five or
Four of them, empowering them to meet and devise,
<span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>and exactly preponderate all the Statutes and Ordinances
of the Order, as well such as were established at
the Foundation, as those that had been since made, by
Explanation or Addition, and to weigh advisedly whether
any Thing had been enacted, that had caused
Doubt or Ambiguity, or stood in need of any Change or
Amendment; and if upon mature Deliberation by them
thus conven’d, there should appear any Contrariety or
Defect, for want of plain Expression, or other Omission,
fit to be supplied, tending to the Honour of the
Order, That then the Sovereign might, upon Return
of their Proceedings, resolve upon some general Declaration
in Chapter, to reform and reduce into one Body
all the Statutes and Ordinances thereof, that the same
being compil’d and settled in one perfect Model, might
be so consign’d to Posterity, free from all future Questions
and Doubts.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Nevertheless</span> not any thing was done upon this
Commission, tho’ it stood in force even from the 6th
to the 13th Year of this King’s Reign; but where the
Neglect lay History does not fully inform us, tho’ it
may be conjectur’d by what follows.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>At</span> the Feast of St. <i>George</i>, celebrated by Prorogation
at <i>White-hall</i>, for the Year 1636. upon the 17th, 18th,
and 19th Days of <i>April</i>, 1637. divers Petitions for Reformation,
and reducing of Matters to their pristine
Constitution, were presented to the Sovereign by the
Chancellor, and read; some of which, more especially,
tending to set off and encrease the Honour of the
Order, were received and decreed by the Sovereign,
and the rest referr’d to the said Knights-Commissioners.
The first of those Decrees which at that time had its
Sanction, was to revive and renew the Powers given in
the former Commission; and thereupon a new one,
dated the 7th of <i>May</i> following, was issued under the
Great Seal of the Order, and directed to the Earls of
<i>Mulgrave</i>, <i>Darby</i>, <i>Pembroke</i>, and <i>Montgomery</i>, <i>Arundel</i>,
and <i>Surry</i>, <i>Kelly</i>, <i>Salisbury</i>, <i>Dorset</i>, <i>Holland</i>, <i>Barkshire</i>,
<i>Suffolk</i>, <i>Lyndsey</i>, <i>Exeter</i>, Marquiss <i>Hamilton</i>, Duke of
<i>Lenox</i>, the Earls of <i>Darby</i>, <i>Moreton</i>, and <i>Northumberland</i>,
or to Three or more of them, to meet and consult of
any Matters contain’d in the Statutes, or for Honour of
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>the Order. These Knights-Commissioners were endow’d
with all the plenary Powers given in the foresaid
Commission, dated 6 <i>Car.</i> I. unto which was granted a
further Addition, for the better effecting the Sovereign’s
Care: That Three or more of them should meet at
the Sovereign’s Court, and begin to put the said Commission
in execution in <i>Whitson</i> Week next ensuing, attended
and assisted by the Chancellor of the Order, and
all, or any other Officers, or such of them as they
should fix on, or find serviceable. And being assembled,
to have free Liberty to hear, propound, and debate
of whatsoever shall fall under their Cognisance,
or that they should conceive conducible to the Honour
and perfect Establishment of so Illustrious and Noble a
Body. And to prepare all Matters of such their Resolutions
and Debates to be laid before the Sovereign
at the next Feast of St. <i>George</i>, and so successively at every
Chapter so appointed by him, to receive his full
Determination, Approbation, and Royal Assent, with
further Power to adjourn from time to time, after the
first Opening and Reading of the said Commission;
their Meetings to be in such Places, and on such Days as
should seem most convenient to them.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Now</span> who wou’d suppose, that after so Noble an Intention
of the Sovereign, and his earnest Solicitude to
issue forth a second Commission, his hearty recommending
and exciting their Deligence for a speedy Dispatch,
and lastly, his expecting an Account of their
Transactions the next Feast, these honourable Persons,
Companions of the Order, should need a Spur to accomplish
so laudable a Design; but it was so.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>For</span> altho’ the Commission was opened at <i>White-hall</i>
the 30th of May following, in the Presence of the
Earls of <i>Pembroke</i> and <i>Montgomery</i>, <i>Salisbury</i>, <i>Holland</i>,
Marquiss of <i>Hamilton</i>, and Duke of <i>Lenox</i>, Commissioners;
yet Sir <i>Thomas Row</i> Chancellor, in his Letter to
Dr. <i>Christopher Wren</i>, dated the 4th of <i>June</i>, 1637. sadly
complained, That it was much as he could do to
draw together Five of the Knights-Companions, to open
and read the Commission, and this <i>quasi in transitu</i>,
was in Confusion and Hurry, and all that was transacted
was to appoint another Convention at Court in <i>Midsummer</i>
<span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>Week then next ensuing, and charge the Chancellor
to prepare Matter (for Propositions and Observations
upon the Statutes) fit for their Consultations against
that Appointment, according to the Tenor of the
Commission. And in another Place writes, That he
found such Difficulty to procure Meetings, and as certain
<i>non Chalance</i> in every one, as if it were but a ceremonious
Affair, and so few hearty in it, that he feared
he and the Officers should wait to little Purpose: And so
indeed it fell out; for albeit he attended in <i>Midsummer</i>
Week, according to their Direction, yet there was nothing
dispatch’d, save only the adjourning of their
Meeting to <i>London</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Some</span> little Progress was afterwards made in this Affair
at <i>White-hall</i> the 8th of <i>February</i> following, where
Three of them were present, <i>viz.</i> the Earls of <i>Berkshire</i>,
<i>Lindsey</i>, and <i>Northumberland</i>, who order’d the
Chancellor, Register, and Garter, to prepare an Abbreviation
of the Statutes, and reduce every thing of one
Head into an Act, to keep up to Method, and avoid
Confusion.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> 1st of <i>February</i> after, another Assembly of Seven
of the Knights-Commissioners was held at <i>White-hall</i>, in
whose Presence a few Points were debated; but little or
nothing concluded.</p>

<p class='c008'>§ 4. <span class='sc'>As</span> concerning the Annals of the Order, or the
Books wherein the several Resolutions and Decrees occasionally
made in Chapters, and wherein other historical
and ceremonial Matters relating to it are recorded,
it will not be amiss to give some Account of them
in this Place.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> first, in Order of time, is an old Paper Book
written in <i>French</i>, call’d <i>Registrum Chartaceum</i>, hitherto
fortunately preserv’d in the Paper Office at <i>White-hall</i>,
which probably was begun by <i>John Coningham</i>; for we
find him, 1414. (a little before the Annals commenced)
made Canon of <i>Windsor</i>, and Register of the Order,
and in regard the same Hand-Writing is carry’d
on from the Beginning of the Book down to 16 <i>Hen.</i> VI.
inclusive, where follows an <i>Hiatus</i> till <i>Anno</i> 23 <i>Hen.</i> VI.
that the Annals began to be set down with another
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>Hand; and that he shortly after died in 1445. Henceforward
these Annals are entred with promiscuous Hands,
which may be presumed the proper Hand-Writings of
the Registers of this Noble Order, as they succeeded
each other in the Office.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>After</span> we find <i>Richard Sidnor</i> mention’d in the Register
<i>Anno</i> 16 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. (who subscribed his Name at the foot
of every Leaf) the Annals were pen’d in one Hand until
<i>Anno</i> 26 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. that <i>Robert Aldrydge</i>, D. D. and one of
the Canons of <i>Windsor</i> succeeded him; and then ’tis
evident the Writing also was changed to an old set
<i>Roman</i> Hand, which ran on to the End of 29 <i>Hen.</i> VIII.
in which Year he was advanced to the Bishoprick of
<i>Carlisle</i>; and this Book breaks off in the 31st of his
Reign.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Besides</span> this there is another Book that goes by the
Name of the <i>Black Book</i>, wherein the Annals of the
Order are transcribed in <i>Latin</i>, concerning which there
pass’d a Decree, <i>Anno</i> 3 <i>Hen.</i> VII. that it should be fairly
copy’d out, and afterwards that the Sovereign should
be put in Remembrance of it; but neither of these Decrees
was put in execution, nor was this confirm’d till
towards the End of the Reign of King <i>Henry</i> VIII.
This Book differs very little from the <i>Registrum
Chartaceum</i>, for therein is nothing enrolled relating to the
Order (except one of the Exemplars of the Founders
Statutes, and a Catalogue of the first Twenty-five
Knights-Companions) before the 4th Year of King
<i>Henry</i> V. the Annals of the Order, until that time, being
entirely lost. It hath the same Hiatus or Intervals
from 16 to 23 <i>Hen.</i> VI. from 7 to 10 of <i>Edw.</i> 4. from
4 to 7 <i>Hen.</i> VII. and from 10 to 14 <i>Hen.</i> 7. It also runs
parallel therewith for the most part, and that it was
compil’d by Dr. <i>Aldrydge</i>, whilst he continu’d Register,
is collected from some Passages in the Preface of all the
Sovereigns, ending with King <i>Henry</i> VIII. The Transcription
of this Book was finish’d <i>Anno</i> 13 <i>Hen.</i> VIII.
for so far is written, as also the Appendix, with one
and the same Hand; (in a middle-siz’d Text) but <i>Anno</i>
32 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. another Hand appears, which, with some
Variation, is continu’d to the End of 5 <i>Edw.</i> VI. where
this Book breaks off.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span><span class='sc'>The</span> Register of the Order was oblig’d to provide
Two Books, and therein to enter the Ordinances,
Statutes, and Acts of this Noble Corporation, one to be
lodg’d at the Chapter House at <i>Windsor</i>, and call’d, <i>Index
Windesoriensis</i>, and the other being a Duplicate of the
former, to remain in his own Custody, ready to expose
to the View of the Sovereign, whensoever he should
demand it; this latter was called <i>Aulæ Registrum</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>As</span> to the general Directions for Compiling these
Books, and the Particulars they are to consist of, we
are inform’d from the said Statutes and Constitutions;
for besides the Entry of all the Scrutinies taken in
Chapter and Elections made thereupon, it is his Office
to record the Penalties inflicted on Knights-Companions,
and the Reconciliation of all Delinquents with
other Acts, and their Causes appertaining to the Order,
all which are decreed to be recited before the Sovereign
and Knights-Companions at the Beginning of the
Chapter yearly, if Occasion be, to correct and reduce
into Method. Moreover he is to record all the Policies
in War, Exploits, Transactions, and memorable
Atchievements, both of the Sovereign and Knights-Companions,
according as he can best attain the Knowledge
of them, by his own diligent Search, or the Assistance
of Mr. Garter, which having consign’d to Writing
from Year to Year, is to be perused at the next
Chapter by the Knights-Companions, for their Approbation
and Correction; and being reiterated the second
time in the Chapter, he is to see that they be fairly engrossed
in the said Book, for a perpetual Remembrance.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>And</span> because the time perfix’d for Rehearsal of these
Particulars in Chapter, had in succeeding Years been
imploy’d in other Affairs. In one of those Articles
which the Knights-Companions exhibited to King
<i>Jac.</i> I. the 19th of <i>May, Anno Jac.</i> R. 20. and ratified
the 22d of <i>May</i> following, it was decreed that nothing
of this Nature, or any other Act in Chapter,
should be registred before it had been perus’d and pass’d
the Consideration of the then Knights-Companions, or
at least Four of them, who when they should set Times
apart to consult of the Affairs of this Order (for which
<span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>they were chiefly commission’d) might then also make
Use of such Opportunities as should give this Business
Dispatch with more Conveniency. Upon mature Consideration
had of those Injunctions, the then Register at
a Chapter held 19 <i>Nov.</i> 22 <i>Car.</i> II. presented the Continuation
of the Annals of this Order, which he had
ranged in order to register in the <i>Liber Carolinus</i>, and
submitted them to the Approbation of the Knights-Companions,
whom the Sovereign had commission’d to
inspect the Affairs of the Order; which Tender, when
they declin’d, he propos’d that it might pass the Examination
of the Prelate; but they not giving their Assent
to it, in regard the Register himself was under
the Obligation of an Oath, to deal with the utmost Fidelity
in his Reports, it was decreed, That the said
Annals should be fairly recorded in the Book, without
any further Inspection.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Besides</span> the abovemention’d Particulars, there were
Materials of another Nature, decreed to be collected
by the Chancellor of the Order and Garter King of
Arms, to be digested first, and after entred by the Register;
for whereas one part of the Chancellor’s Duty
was to make a Narration every Year in Chapter, at the
Feast of St. <i>George</i>, of the illustrious Exploits of the
Knights-Companions, as well as the Actions that tend
to eclipse their Glory; so the Register was to note these,
and record them from a perpetual Æra or Memorial of
their Honour or Disgrace.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>And</span> it is part of Garter’s Duty diligently to enquire
after the Valiant, Fortunate, and Renown’d Acts, both
of the Sovereign and the rest of the Knights-Companions,
and relate them with all Exactness to the Register,
for his Engrossing: But how sparingly these are put in
execution, the Annals themselves bear witness. However,
Sir <i>Edward Walker</i> Garter-King has drawn up an
Account of the shining Actions and Characters of the
Knights-Companions, beginning with <i>Thomas</i> Earl of
<i>Strafford</i>, and continuing it down to his Son, which he
deliver’d Dr. <i>Ryves</i> the Register, for the Use afore-directed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Among</span> the Articles establish’d at the Feast of
St. <i>George</i>, 21 <i>Jac.</i> I. the last is, That the then Register
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>should compose a Book, wherein should be orderly transcribed
the Form and Manner of all the Solemnities, Ceremonies,
and Processions, at the Celebration of the Order;
as also of taking down and offering the defunct
Knight’s Atchievements, that the Knights-Companions
might have free Recourse to it; but such Book never was
extant.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the Safety and Preservation of the <i>Annals</i>, the
Knights-Commissioners determined the 22nd of <i>May, An.
Jac.</i> I. 20. That a secure and convenient Place within the
Castle of <i>Windsor</i> should be appointed, in which all Acts
concerning the Order should be reposed, and to which
every Knight-Companion at all times might have access.
And upon the Remove or Decease of the Register of
the Order, the Book, containing the Account of all such
Transactions, should be committed to one of the Knights
of the Order.</p>

<p class='c000'>The second of these Books is called the <i>Blue Book</i>, so
call’d, being bound in Blue Velvet; it begins with the
first Year of Queen <i>Mary</i>, and ends at the 18th of King
<i>Jac.</i> I.</p>

<p class='c000'>The third being bound in Red Velvet, is denominated
the <i>Red Book</i>; it commences where the <i>Blue Book</i> leaves
off, and treats of the like Acts and Entries, and is carry’d
down to 14 <i>Car.</i> I: having first given a full Account of
the Installation of the Prince, afterwards King <i>Charles</i> II.
And as to great part of this Work, it was perform’d by
the elegant and judicious Dr. <i>Matthew Wren</i>, Bishop of
<i>Ely</i>, and Register of the Order, whose excellent Pattern
his Brother and Successor Dr. <i>Christopher Wren</i> hath copy’d
in its following Tract. This Bishop compiled a MS.
<i>A. D.</i> 1631. wherein, by way of Comment upon King
<i>Henry</i> VIII’s Statutes, he hath compendiously shewn what
Alteration there hath passed in the Law of the Garter, a
Work performed with great Judgment, and exceedingly
useful to the Curious.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fourth and last Book is, <i>Liber Carolinus</i>, and commences
1640. wherein the <i>Annals</i> are brought down to
the beginning of 1670. by <i>Ryves</i>, then Register. And
in a Chapter conven’d at <i>Windsor</i> the 16th of <i>April, Anno</i>
13 <i>Car.</i> II. it was decreed, That there should be Two
of these Books compiled, the one printed in <i>Latin</i>, in
the Custos of the Register at <i>Windsor</i>; and the other in
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span><i>English</i>, to be reserv’d at <i>Whitehall</i>, and call’d, <i>Registrum
Aulicum</i>.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch07' class='c005'>CAP. VII.<br /> <br /><i>The</i> Habit <i>and</i> Ensigns <i>of the Order</i>.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c007'>THE Habit and Ensigns of this most Noble Order
are most eminently distinguishable and magnificent,
and consist of these Particulars, <i>viz.</i> Garter,
Mantle, Surcoat, Hood, George, and Collar; for as the
<i>Romans</i> were very exact and particular in assigning each
Degree a peculiar Habit and Vesture, by which the Quality
and Rank of their Citizens might be discernable, the
Distinction of Apparel was afterwards taken up by divers
other Nations, whence every Military, as well as Ecclesiastick
Order of Knighthood, did appropriate to it self
a peculiar Dress, Ensign, or Badge, as a Mark of Distinction
one from another, to set off the Lustre and Honour
of their several Societies.</p>

<p class='c000'>The four first, <i>viz.</i> the Garter, Mantle, Surcoat, and
Hood, were assigned the Knights Companions, by the
Founder, and the George and Collar by King <i>Henry</i> VIII.
and all these together are called the whole Habit or Ensigns
of the Order, which we shall treat of succinctly,
beginning with the Garter.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Royal Garter challengeth the Preheminence, for
from it this famous Order receiv’d its Denomination: It
is the first part of the Habit presented to Foreign Princes
and Absent Knights, and that wherewith they, and all
other elect Knights, are first adorn’d; and of so great
Honour and Grandeur, that by the bare Investiture with
this Noble Ensign, the Knights are esteem’d Companions
of the greatest Military Order in the World.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Materials whereof it was compos’d at first, is
an <i>Arcanum</i>; nor is it described by any before <i>Polydore
Virgil</i>, and he but in general: As to the ornamental Part
of it, it was adorn’d with Gold and precious Stones,
and had a Buckle of Gold at the End, to fasten it about
<span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span>the Leg; but there’s no doubt but it was wrought with
rich Embroidery, and the Motto rais’d with Gold,
Pearl, and sundry Sorts of Silk, as may be guess’d
from the Garters anciently plac’d on the left side of the
Knights-Companions Mantles, and those other little
embroider’d Garters, wherewith their Surcoats and
Hoods were heretofore embellish’d.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>But</span> of those wrought in the last Age, we have more
particular Satisfaction; for we find the Garter sent to
<i>Emanuel</i> Duke of <i>Savoy</i>, <i>Anno</i> 1 and 2 <i>Philip</i> and <i>Mary</i>,
was set with Letters of Goldsmith’s Work, the Buckle
and Pendant of the same, and on the Pendant a Ruby,
and a Pearl hanging at the End. The Garter made for
<i>Francis</i> II. <i>Anno</i> 6 <i>Elizabeth</i>, was richly wrought with
Letters of Gold, set off and garnish’d with Stones,
the Buckle and Pendant weighing Three Ounces and
an half-quarter, was richly set with Rubies and Diamonds.
The <i>French</i> King <i>Henry</i> IV. had a Garter of
Purple Velvet embroider’d with Letters of Gold, and
deck’d out with Diamonds and Rubies. And the Garter
of <i>Christian</i> IV. King of <i>Denmark</i>, was embroider’d
with Gold and Pearls: But that Garter sent to <i>Gustavus
Adolphus</i> King of <i>Sweden</i>, outvied all others conferr’d
by former Sovereigns, each Letter of the Motto being
compos’d of small Diamonds; and for every Stop, a
Diamond within a Range of Diamonds, above and below,
on the sides of the Garter, and besides other Diamonds
on the Buckle, and about the same, to the Number
in all of 411.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Garter which King <i>Charles</i> I. wore upon his Leg
at the Time of his Martyrdom, had the Letters of the
Motto compos’d likewise of Diamonds, which amounted
to the Number of 412. It came to the Hands of
Captain <i>Preston</i> (one of the Usurper’s Captains) from
whom the Trustees, for Sale of the King’s Goods, receiv’d
it, and sold it to <i>Ireton</i>, sometimes Lord Mayor of
<i>London</i>, for 205 <i>l.</i> But after the Restoration, the King’s
Attorney-General proceeding upon an Action of <i>Trover</i>
and <i>Conversion</i>, Verdict was given for the King against
him for 205 <i>l.</i> and 10 <i>l.</i> costs of Suits, in <i>Trinity</i> Term,
16 <i>Car.</i> II.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span><span class='sc'>The</span> Motto of King <i>Charles</i> II. was set with Diamonds
upon Blue Velvet, and the Borders wrought
with fine Gold Wire; the Diamonds which framed
the Letters of the Motto, were Rose Diamonds, much
of a Size or Proportion; but those which framed the
Stops, Table-Diamonds; the Total which set each Letter,
compos’d the Stops, Ilot Holes, and adorn’d the
Buckle; the Table was Two Hundred and Fifty; the
Hinge of the Buckle was pure Gold, and on it the Sovereign’s
Picture to the Breast, curiously cut in Flat-stitch,
crown’d with a Laurel and the military Garb
of the first <i>Roman</i> Emperors; the Table or Pendant
was Gold, and on the back-side thereof engrav’d St.
<i>George</i> on Horse-back encountring the Dragon.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>This</span> noble Ensign, the Garter, was at the Erection
of the Order appointed to be wore on the left Leg, a
little beneath the Knee, which Usage still presides:
And the placing it thus, on the Sepulchral Portraictures
of Knights-Companions, was an early Custom; for on
the Alabaster Monument of Sir <i>William Fitz-warin</i>, who
was interr’d in the North-side of the Chancel at <i>Wantage</i>
in <i>Com. Berks</i>, 35 <i>Edw.</i> III. he lies there with his
Surcoat of Arms upon his Breast, and the Representation
of a Garter (but without Motto) carv’d upon his
left Leg. In the same Posture lies Sir <i>Richard Pembridge</i>,
elected a Knight-Companion, <i>temp. Edw.</i> III.
and is portraicted on his Monument in the South-side
of the Cathedral of <i>Hereford</i>, below the Pulpit, and encompass’d
with a Rail of Iron-Spikes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> next Monument whereon the Garter was depicted,
was that erected for Sir <i>Simon Burley</i>, (beheaded
<i>A. D.</i> 1388.) and rear’d in the North-Wall near the
Choir of St. <i>Paul</i>’s, <i>London</i>. Thence-forward the Practice
became more frequent, and then the Motto began
to be cut thereon; insomuch that it is now the constant
and just Practice to do it, whensoever the Knights-Companions
are exhibited in Effigies.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>And</span> altho’ this Ensign was first design’d in Ornament
to the left Leg, yet it was not confin’d so solely
thereto, but was anciently us’d to incircle the Escutcheon
of St. <i>George</i>’s Arms, worn by the Sovereign and
Knights-Companions on their Mantles, who within a
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>small space after us’d it to surround their own proper
Coat of Arms, which their Successors have retain’d as
their peculiar Privilege, permitting it to none but to
their principal Officer, the Prelate of the Order.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> first Example that occurs, is the before-mention’d
of Sir <i>Francis Burley</i>, where, on the Front, towards
the Head, is his own Arms empaling his first
Wife’s, set within a Garter, (wanting the Impress;)
but another having the same Empalement, (plac’d below
the Feet) is surrounded with a Collar of SS. of
the same Form with that about his Neck.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Monument also of <i>Joan</i>, Wife of <i>Ralph Nevil</i>,
Earl of <i>Westmoreland</i>, on the South-side of the Choir,
in the Cathedral of <i>Lincoln</i>, bears the Arms of <i>Nevil</i>,
empaling those of <i>Joan</i>, his Wife, (who dy’d <i>A. D.</i>
1410.) Incircled within a Garter, and fix’d on this
Lady’s Monument, Daughter to <i>John</i> of <i>Gaunt</i>, Duke of
<i>Lancaster</i>, is there such a Collar of SS. placed about a
Square; but the Paint being faded, was render’d unintelligible.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Another</span> antique Instance is that Escutcheon, <i>Sable,
Three Ostrich Feathers Argent</i>, surrounded with the Garter,
affix’d in the Glass-Windows of <i>Greenwich</i>-Church
in <i>Kent</i>, by <i>Humfrey</i>, Duke of <i>Glocester</i>, and Supported
with a Greyhound and an Antelope. It is reported,
these Three Feathers were the Ensign of King <i>Henry</i> IV.
which were conferr’d by <i>John</i> of <i>Gaunt</i>, his Father,
who bore them for his Device, and placed in a <i>Field
Sable</i>, as here, but the Pens were powder’d with <i>Ermin</i>,
for a difference from the Black Prince’s Feather, which
were <i>Argent</i>, as the King’s Pen was <i>Or</i>, and the Duke
of <i>Somerset</i>’s Compony <i>Argent</i> and <i>Azure</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Arms of Sir <i>Lewis Robessart</i>, Lord <i>Bourchier</i>,
Knight-Companion, <i>temp. Hen.</i> V. we find encompass’d
with a Garter on each side his Monument, in <i>Westminster-Abbey</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>At</span> the Interment of <i>Richard</i> Duke of <i>York</i>, Father
to King <i>Edw.</i> IV. at every Corner of the Majesty-Escutcheon
(set over the Image of the Defunct) was an
Escutcheon of the Arms of <i>France</i> and <i>England quarterly</i>,
and <i>Four Angels Gold</i>, holding the same within a Garter.
And so some of the Funeral Escutcheons of <i>John</i> Viscount
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span><i>Wells</i>, (who dy’d 14 <i>Hen.</i> VII.) were surrounded
with the Garter, as others bearing his Lady’s Arms.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>At</span> the Interment of <i>Thomas</i> Duke of <i>Norfolk</i>, in <i>Thetford-Abbey</i>,
(who dy’d 16 <i>Hen.</i> VIII.) there was provided
a Shield of his Arms within a Garter, and a
Coronet affix’d over it; a Target also of the Arms of
<i>George</i>, Earl of <i>Shrewsbury</i>, within a Garter, was born
at his Funural, <i>Anno</i> 33 <i>Hen.</i> VIII.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>It</span> was the Custom, (begun about the Reign of
<i>Hen.</i> VII.) when the Obsequies of any Foreign Prince
were celebrated in <i>England</i>, to paint an Escutcheon of
such Prince’s Arms within the Collar of the Order,
whereof he was Sovereign or a Fellow-Companion;
as those of the <i>French</i> King, <i>Charles</i> VIII. celebrated at
St. <i>Paul</i>’s, <i>London</i>, had Escutcheons of the Arms of
<i>France</i>, within the Collar of the Order of St. <i>Michael</i>,
at each End of the Hearse; and when the Obsequies
of <i>John</i> King of <i>Portugal</i> were solemniz’d at St. <i>Paul</i>’s,
there was, among others, one large Escutcheon of his
Arms within the Collar of the <i>Golden Fleece</i>. The Funeral
Rites of the Emperor <i>Charles</i> V. being perform’d
in <i>Westminster-Abbey</i>, 22 and 23 <i>Dec.</i> 1558. there were
Ten great Escutcheons compass’d with Garters, to shew
he was a Fellow of this Order: And upon the same
Account, where Princes were Sovereigns of one, and
Companions of another Order, their Hearses were
hung with Escutcheons of their Arms, surrounded with
the Collars or principal Badges of both those Orders;
as at the Interment of <i>Francis</i> I. the <i>French</i> King, celebrated
at St. <i>Paul</i>’s, <i>London</i>, 1 <i>Edw.</i> VI. the Escutcheons
were the Arms of <i>France</i>, encompass’d within the Garter
of St. <i>George</i>, and Collar of St. <i>Michael</i>. At the Obsequies
of <i>Hen.</i> II. of <i>France</i>, <i>Anno</i> 1 <i>Eliz.</i> at St. <i>Paul</i>’s
also, there were some Escutcheons of his Arms, incircled
both with the Garter and Collar of the <i>Golden
Fleece</i>, having been a Knight-Companion of both these
Orders: Under the Joysts was a Majesty Escutcheon of
Black Taffaty of this King’s Arms, within a Garter
crown’d with an Imperial Crown, and in several Places
of the Hearse were fasten’d other Escutcheons of his
Arms within this principal Ensign of the Garter.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span><span class='sc'>King</span> <i>Hen.</i> VIII. was the first that introduc’d into his
Great Seal the Eschutcheon of his Arms incircled within
a Garter, as may be seen placed on either side his
Portraiture sitting on his Royal Throne; since him,
all succeeding Sovereigns have born their Arms after
that Manner, not only in their great and Privy-Seals,
but in those other appertaining to their Courts of Justice,
and generally in all Matters where their Arms
were visible (except Coins); in Imitation of whom,
the Knight-Companions have done the like.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>But</span> there were <i>An.</i> 21 <i>Car.</i> 1. certain Half Crowns
stamp’d in the West of <i>England</i>, containing the Sovereigns
Arms, so encompassed, regally crowned and
supported; and this was the first Money whereon the
Royal Garter appeared. After him King <i>Charles</i> II.
having an Eye to the Advancement of the Honour of
this Order, caused the irradicated Cross of St. <i>George</i> encompass’d
about with the Royal Garter to be publickly
stamp’d in the Center of his Silver Coin, struck upon
the Recoinage of it, <i>Anno</i> 14. <i>Car.</i> 2.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>There</span> were other Medals heretofore stamp’d upon
several Occasions, wherein the Garter was designedly
express’d, and enclosing Shields of their Arms; as that
in the Year 1619. <i>Frederick</i> Prince <i>Palatine</i> of the <i>Rhine</i>,
was crowned King of <i>Bohemia</i>, and <i>Robert Cecil</i> Earl of
<i>Salisbury</i> created Lord Treasurer, both Knights Companions
of this Noble Order: Moreover, Gold Rings
have been cast into the Figures of Garters; the Ground
on the outside enamell’d with a deep Blue, through
which the golden Letters of the Motto appearing, set
them off with an admirable Beauty. And it seems such
Rings were in vogue since the Preface to the black
Book of the Order makes mention of wearing the Garter
on the Leg and Shoulder, and sometimes likewise subjoins
the Thumb, <i>interdum Pollice gestare</i>; by which we
may naturally conjecture, that Gold Rings were formed
into the Fashion of Garters, and bestowed by some new
installed Knights upon their Relations and Friends to
wear in Memorial of so great an Honour conferred upon
them.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Among</span> the Officers belonging to the Order the Prelate
is permitted to bear his proper Arms (impaled with
<span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>those of his See) within the Garter, and the rest only
to wear the Badges of their Offices, surrounded with
the same to express their peculiar Relation.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Besides</span> the Manner of bearing Arms, within the Garter
of this Order, the Garter either in whole or part, hath
been by Way of Armory, but without the Motto; as in the
Seal belonging to the Office of Garter King of Arms,
where the Garter (enclosing a Crown) is placed on a Chief,
between a <i>Lyon</i> of <i>England</i> and a <i>Flower de Lys</i> of <i>France</i>.
And to instance in Family, we find Argent Three <i>Demy-Garters
Azure</i>, buckled and garnished, <i>Or</i>, granted by
King <i>Hen.</i> VII. to his Servant <i>Peter Nerborne</i>, and sable a
Garter, <i>Or</i>, between Three Buckles of the Second, to be
born by <i>Buckland</i> or <i>Bowland in Com. Northampton</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>§. 2. <span class='sc'>The</span> second Ensign of the Order is the <i>Mantle</i>,
which is the Chief of those Vestments which the Sovereign
and Knights-Companions make use of upon all
solemn Occasions relating to the Order. That this
Pattern was derived to us from the ancient <i>Greeks</i> and
<i>Romans</i>, is not at all to be disputed, since it so little varies
in Fashion from their <i>Pallium</i> or <i>Toga</i>; for the <i>Grecian</i>
Pallium was a sort of long Cloak, which only
wanted a Collar or Cape, and the <i>Roman Toga</i> as proper
to them, as the <i>Pallium</i> to the <i>Grecians</i>, and the Custom
as Antique as <i>Romulus</i> himself; for he is recited by
<i>Plutarch</i> to have worn it. The Pallium is more fully
described to be a kind of upper Robe that covered the
whole Body, made fast on the right Shoulder with a
Fibula or Clasp. It was usually worn over the Tunica
or short Coat, whence the Proverb <i>Tunica Pallio propior</i>,
and is more particularly observed to have been a Garment
fashioned without Sleeves, that reached down to
the Ancles.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> describing this upper Robe, called the <i>Mantle</i>,
(the Sovereigns being distinguished from the Knights-Companions,
only by a long Train) we shall first set
down its various Appellations it is mentioned by in the
Records of the Order; Secondly, the Materials whereof
it consists; Thirdly, the Colour; Fourthly, the
Quantity; and last of all the Ornamental Trimmings,
that nothing be omitted to satisfy any curious Enquirer.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>
<h3 class='c010'>NAME.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>In</span> the Founder’s Statutes it is called <i>Mantellum</i>, and
in <i>Hen.</i> V. <i>Manteau</i>, both which we render <i>Mantle</i>. But
the Exemplar of the Founder’s Statutes entred in the
black Book, and the Statutes of King <i>Henry</i> VIII. call
it <i>Trabea</i>, which <i>Rosinus</i> reckons among the different
Kinds of <i>Mantles</i> or <i>Gowns</i>. And in 20 <i>Art.</i> of King <i>Hen.</i>
VIIIth’s Statutes, it is applied both to the <i>Mantle</i> and
<i>Surcoat</i>; sometime it is stiled <i>Chlamyda</i>; sometime
<i>Stola</i>; but in other Places more pertinently, <i>Pallium</i> and
<i>Toga</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>MATERIALS.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>That</span> Mantle prepared for the Founder against the
first Feast of this Order, appears to be fine Woollen Cloth,
and it is not improbable this Material was chosen, rather
than any other richer, to the Intent the Founder might
give the Preference to our native Commodity, altho’
there’s permitted in the Statutes of Institution a permission
for the Proxies of Foreign Princes to bring over
with them Mantles of Silk and Velvet when they came
to receive possession of their Principal Stalls, either because
other Countries were better stored with such
Commodities than our <i>English</i> Cloth, or that it might
be more agreeable to represent the State and Grandeur
of Foreign Princes, as accounting Silk or Velvet the
nobler Representation.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>What</span> Duration the wearing Cloth had, is not directly
set down, but the first time we discover their
Mantles to be of Velvet, is about the beginning of the
Reign of King <i>Hen.</i> VI. which Sort of Silk hath thence
remained until this Day. About this Period, ’tis observed,
that the Mantles of Foreign Princes were made
here of Velvet, for so was that transmitted to the King
of <i>Portugal</i>, elected <i>Anno</i> 1346. Concerning the Mantles
of the Knights-Companions, there is no doubt
but they were of the same Materials with those made
for the Sovereign, <i>viz.</i> at first of fine Woollen Cloth,
and when the Sovereign exchanged it for Velvet, they
followed his Example; but we cannot meet with equal
Satisfaction in this Point, because the Knights-Companions
provided this Robe at their own Expence; and
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>their private Accounts herein passing thro’ so many Contingences,
were of no great Durability. But their
Surcoats were of the Sovereigns Donation, and consequently
the Particulars of them remain on Record in
the Rolls and Accounts of the great Wardrobe.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Colour of these Mantles is appointed by the
Statutes to be Blue, and of this Colour was the Founders;
by which, as by the Ground-work of the Royal
Garter, it is not improbable he alluded to the Colour
of the Field in the <i>French</i> Arms, which a few Years before
he began to Quarter with those of <i>England</i>. But
the Colour of the Surcoat was changed every Year, as
will appear by and by. Of the same Colour were the
Velvet Mantles, made <i>temp. Hen.</i> VI. who tho’ he altered
the Stuff, did not vary the Dye. It is apparent,
that the blue Colour was retained to King <i>Edw.</i> IVth’s
Reign, for when this Sovereign transmitted the Habit
and Ensigns of the Order to <i>Julian de Medicis</i>, the
Mantle was of blue Velvet.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>But</span> in King <i>Hen.</i> VIIIth’s Statutes there’s no mention
at all of the Colour of this upper Robe, save only of
the <i>Mantle</i>, which the Proxy of a Foreign Prince was
enjoined to bring with him when he came to assume the
Stall of his Principal; which, tho’ it does not come directly
up to the Point, yet it is to be observed to be of blue
Velvet. And it’s highly probable that the blue Colour
remained still to be used; for within a few Months after
the compiling the said Statutes, it’s plain, the Mantle
sent to <i>James</i> King of <i>Scotland</i>, was of blue Velvet, and
in the ancient Form of Admonition and Signification appointed
to be spoke at the Investiture of Foreign Princes,
and then in Plea it is called <i>the Mantle of celestial Colour</i>.
Likewise the Mantle sent to <i>Emanuel</i> Duke of <i>Savoy</i>,
1 and 2 <i>Ph.</i> and <i>Mar.</i> was of the same Composure.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>’s Reign, upon what Ground
History is silent, the Colour of Foreign Prince’s
Mantles was changed from Blue to Purple, for of
that Colour were the Mantles sent to the <i>French</i> Kings,
<i>Charles</i> IX. <i>Anno.</i> 6 <i>Eliz.</i> and <i>Hen.</i> III. <i>Ann.</i> 27 <i>Eliz.</i> So
also to the Emperor <i>Maximilian</i> 9 <i>Elizabeth</i>, to <i>Fredrick</i> II.
King of <i>Denmark</i>, <i>An.</i> 24 <i>Eliz.</i> to <i>Joh. Casimire</i> Count
Palatine of the <i>Rhine</i>, <i>Anno</i> 21 <i>Eliz.</i> to <i>Christiern</i> IV.
<span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span>King of <i>Denmark</i>, <i>An. J. R.</i> IV. But that sent to <i>Frederick</i>
Duke of <i>Wirtemberg</i> in the same Year, was a mix’d
Colour of Purple and Violet.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Thus</span> the Purple Colour came in Request, and continued
till about the 12 of King <i>Charles</i> I. when he determining
to restore the Colour of the Mantle to the primitive
Institution, gave Directions to Mr. <i>Peter Richaut</i>,
Merchant, to provide himself with a Quantity of rich
blue Velvets from <i>Genoa</i>; and upon their arrival into
<i>England</i>, signify’d his Pleasure by Sir <i>Thomas Rowe</i> the
Chancellor, That all Knights-Companions should purchase
as much of the said Velvet as would furnish them
with new Robes against St. <i>George</i>’s-Day next ensuing;
compliance to whose Will, all the Knights paid
Obedience, at the Rate of Thirty seven Shillings a
Yard, being the Price the Sovereign paid to Mr. <i>Richaut</i>
for the Velvet of his own Robes. And the first Essay of
these Mantles was to honour the Installation of the
Prince, afterwards King <i>Charles</i> II.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>And</span> because there were many Knights-elect to be installed
after the Restoration, it was ordained at the
Chapter held at <i>Whitehall</i> the <i>14th</i> of <i>Jan. Anno</i> 12.
<i>Car.</i> 2. (called to consider of the Preparations of the
grand Feast then at hand), That Directions should be
given to the Master of the Wardrobe to negotiate
Abroad for excellent Velvets of Skie Colour, and Crimson,
and other Materials agreeable for the Mantles and
Surcoats, both of the old Knights-Companions, and those
that were then to be installed; which was accordingly
effected, and they were transmitted in time to accommodate
them at the said Feast.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Tho’</span> the just Number of Ells of Cloth for the Sovereigns
Mantle at the first Institution are not set down,
yet in the Total for his Mantle, Hood, and Surcoat,
there was allowed ten Ells of long Cloth. The Mantle
of King <i>Henry</i> VI. took up one Piece, five Ells and
three Quarters of blue Velvet; and those sent to <i>Frederick</i> II.
and <i>Christian</i> IV. Kings of <i>Denmark</i>; and to the
<i>French</i> King, <i>Henry</i> III. contained each twenty Yards of
Velvet.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>This</span> we find to be the Allowance for Foreign Princes,
and are the more full and extensive, by reason of their
<span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>long Train, which being more scanty in the Mantles
of Knights-Subjects, eighteen Yards was sufficient to
make one of them. The full Length of King <i>Charles</i> II.
from the Collar behind to the end of the Train, was
three Yards the Length of the foreside, one Yard and
three Quarters from the Foot along the bottom to the
fixing on of the Train, was two Yards, and from thence
the Length or Compass of the Train, two Yards.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> left Shoulder of each of these Mantles have
from the Institution been adorned with a large fair
Garter, containing this Motto, <i>Honi soit qui mal y pense</i>.
These were distinguished from the lesser Garters, anciently
embroider’d upon the Surcoats and Hoods of
the Sovereigns and Knights-Companions, by the Name
of <i>Garters Gross</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Within</span> this Garter was the Arms of St. <i>George</i>, <i>viz.</i>
Argent a <i>Cross Gules</i>, and was heretofore wrought in Sattin,
with Gold, Silver and Silk; but in descending
Times greater Expence and Magnificence became the
Practice of the Order, for it was embordered upon
Velvet with Damask, Gold, and sundry Sorts of Purls,
Plates, <i>Venice</i> Twists and Silks, and the Letters of the
Motto and Borders of the Garter composed of fair
Oriental Pearl. The Garter fix’d upon the Mantle of
King <i>Charles</i> II. was encircled with large Oriental Pearl,
so were the Letters of the Motto and the Cross within
the Garter, the Diameter of which was seven Inches,
but the Depth from the upper Part to the end of the
Pendant, ten Inches.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Temp. Hen.</i> VI. it seems to have been the Mode to
embellish the Mantle with three or four Velts drawn
down the sides, and round the bottom, as it appears
by the Monument of <i>John Talbot</i> Earl of <i>Shrewsbury</i> in
the South-wall of the Chancel of <i>Whitechurch in Com.
Salop</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>About</span> that Time the Lining of this Robe was white
Damask, and afterwards white Sattin; but of later
Date it was lined with white Taffaty, which continues
yet in vogue.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>For</span> exemplary Ornament, the Mantle had fixed to its
Collar a pair of long Strings, anciently woven of blue
Silk only (called <i>Cordons</i>, Robe-strings or Laces); but
<span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span>of later Days, twisted round and made of <i>Venice</i> Gold
and Silk of the Colour of the Robe, at each end of
which hung a great Knob or Button, wrought over
and raised with a rich Caul of Gold, and Tassels thereunto
of like Silk and Gold.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>And</span> at the Collar was usually fixed an Hook and Eye
of Gold for its firmer affixing of it to the Shoulders.</p>

<p class='c008'>§. 3. <span class='sc'>The</span> Third Ensign of the Order is the <i>Surcoat</i>
or <i>Kirtle</i>, which altho’ we find no Place for it in the
Founder’s Statutes, is nevertheless as ancient as the Mantle
or upper Robe, that is only taken Notice of there,
for such a Vesture King <i>Edward</i> III. then made, together
with his Mantle and a Hood to celebrate the
first Feast of the Order in.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Its</span> Original it owes to the <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Romans</i>; amongst
whom this Garment had its determinated <i>Tunica</i>,
and was worn next under the <i>Toga</i>, but amongst
them was both narrower and shorter; it was girt close
to the Body with a Girdle, and so fitted, that the Hem
of it reached a little below the Knee, or to the middle
of the Ham. It was the proper Mode of the <i>Roman</i> Citizens, and
by its trimming were the three Degrees among
them known; for the Senators Tunicks were embroidered
or purfled over with broad purple Studs, the
Knights with narrow ones, and the Plebeians plain.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> setting forth the Surcoat, which was heretofore
annually bestowed by the Sovereign or the Knights-Companions,
and therefore called his <i>Livery</i>, we shall,
as in the Description of the Mantle, treat somewhat of
the Name, Materials, Colour, Quantity and Garnishing
of it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>As</span> to the Name in the old Rolls of the great Wardrobe,
it is stiled <i>Roba</i>, but more properly as the
Founder’s first Surcoat is called <i>Tunica</i>, which Name it
bears in the red Book of the Order. In <i>English</i> it is rendred
<i>Gown</i>, <i>Kirtle</i>, <i>Surcoat</i>, <i>Undercoat</i> and <i>Robe</i>. The
Appellation of <i>Gown</i> is attributed to <i>Surcoats</i> of the Sovereigns
and Foreign Princes, <i>Temp. Hen.</i> VI. <i>Edw.</i> IV.
and <i>Hen.</i> VII. But since, and very lately, it hath been
bestowed also on the Surcoats of Knights-Companions;
and that of <i>Kirtle</i> sometimes given to those sent to Foreign
<span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>Princes, as appears by the Books of Warrants in
the great Wardrobe, but the rest are Terms of a later
Date: As the first Mantles, so the first Surcoats were
composed of Woollen Cloth, and tho’ the Cloth of the
Mantles was in some space after changed for Velvet, yet
the Surcoats continued afterwards to be of Cloth, at
least till after the Office of Chancellor of the Garter
was erected by King <i>Edward</i> IV. as is manifest by the
Precedent of this Livery in the Sovereigns great Wardrobe;
but in process of Time they became Velvet,
which sort of Silk is yet retained.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Colour of this Vesture was anciently changed
every Year, commonly into Blue, Scarlet, Sanguine in
Grain, or White. But the Colour of the Mantles remained
the same as at the Institution, until Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>’s
Reign, and then it commenced Blue: And ’tis
remarkable, that the Surcoats of the Knights-Companions,
were always of the same Colour with the Sovereigns.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Founder’s first Surcoat was of the same Cloth and
Colour with the Mantle, <i>viz.</i> Blue, but in the 34th Year of
his Reign he altered it to Black, and of the same Colour
were those he conferred that Year upon these following
Knights-Companions, <i>viz.</i> the Black Prince, the Earls
of <i>Ulster</i>, <i>Richmond</i> and <i>Salisbury</i>, <i>Edmund</i> of <i>Langly</i>, Sir
<i>Richard la Vach</i>, Sir <i>Hugh Wrotesly</i>, Sir <i>Reginald Cobham</i>,
Sir <i>Bartholomew Burghest</i>, the Lord <i>Mohun</i>, Sir <i>Walter
Manney</i>, Sir <i>Nele Loring</i>, Sir <i>Walter Paveley</i>, Sir <i>William
Fitz Warin</i>, Sir <i>Miles Stapleton</i>, the Earls of <i>Stafford</i>,
<i>Warwick</i> and <i>Suffolk</i>, and Sir <i>Thomas Ughtred</i>: The
Motive that induced him to pitch upon this sable
Colour, was conceived to be a kind of Humiliation,
because the Pestilence began again to spread its Malevolence,
which had furiously raged Eleven Years before.
The Surcoats which the Sovereign gave the
Dukes of <i>Lancaster</i> and <i>Clarence</i>, and Fourteen other
Knights, <i>Anno</i> 37. <i>Edward</i> III. were of Cloth, Sanguine
in Grain. Those Twenty four provided for the Feast
of St. <i>George</i>, <i>Anno</i> 7 <i>Richard</i> II. were Violet in Grain,
whereof one was for the Sovereign, the other Twenty
three for the Knights-Companions, following <i>John</i> King
of <i>Castile</i>, and <i>Leonard</i> Duke of <i>Lancaster</i>, the Earls of
<span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span><i>Cambridge</i>, <i>Buckingham</i>, <i>Derby</i>, <i>Kent</i>, <i>Warwick</i>, <i>Stafford</i>,
<i>Salisbury</i>, <i>Northumberland</i> and <i>Nottingham</i>, the Lords
<i>Nevil</i>, <i>Basset</i>, and <i>John Holland</i>, Sir <i>Guy Bryan</i>, Sir <i>William
Beauchamp</i>, Sir <i>Thomas Percy</i>, Sir <i>Nele Loring</i>, Sir
<i>John Sulby</i>, Sir <i>Lodowick Clifford</i>, Sir <i>Simon Burley</i>, Sir
<i>Richard Burley</i>, Sir <i>Bryan Stapleton</i> and Sir <i>Soldan de la
Trane</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Anno</i> 11 <i>Richard</i> II. there were ordered against St.
<i>George</i>’s Feast Twenty three Surcoats of white Cloth for
the Sovereign, and Twenty two Knights-Companions;
and the 12 and 19 Year of the same King, the Sovereign
bestowed on the same Persons Surcoats of long
blue Cloth, after the Original Model. The Twenty
two Surcoats made up for the Feast of St. <i>George</i>, <i>Anno</i>
1 <i>Henry</i> V. were of white Cloth; <i>Anno</i> —— <i>Henry</i> VI.
the Sovereigns Gown or Surcoat was of Scarlet, as was
that sent to the King of <i>Portugal</i> in the 13th Year of the
same King. <i>Anno</i> —— <i>Henry</i> VI. the Sovereign had white
Cloth; and so were the Surcoats given to Twenty
Knights-Companions more in the —— Year of his Reign.
Afterwards the beforementioned Four Colours began to
be disused, for the Surcoat presented to <i>Julian de Medicis</i>,
<i>temp. Edward</i> IV. was purple Velvet, and towards
the latter end of the Reign of King <i>Henry</i> VIII. and
since, it is upon Record, the Surcoats of the Sovereign
and all the Knights-Companions were Crimson Velvet,
nor did the Colour suffer a Mutation in the Surcoat,
tho’ King <i>Charles</i> I. restored the Mantle to its first primitive
Colour, <i>Anno</i> 12 <i>Regni sui</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>There</span> has been some disproportion in the Quantity
of the Cloth allowed in the Provision against one
and the same Feast, for <i>Anno</i> 34 <i>Edward</i> III. the Earls
of <i>Stafford</i>, <i>Warwick</i>, and <i>Suffolk</i>, as also Sir <i>Thomas
Ughtred</i> had then for each of their Surcoats six Ells of
Cloth (perhaps the tallness of their Stature required it)
when the other Fifteen Knights were allowed but five
Ells, being the same Quantity the Sovereign’s Surcoat
had contained in it at the same time.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Dukes of <i>Holland</i> and <i>Clarence</i>, <i>Anno</i> 1 <i>Henry</i> V.
with the Earls of <i>Arundel</i>, were allowed Eight Ells a-piece,
the Dukes of <i>Bedford</i>, <i>Gloucester</i> and <i>York</i>, the
Earls of <i>Westmorland</i> and <i>Warwick</i>, the Lords <i>Grey</i>,
<span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span><i>Fitz Hugh</i> and <i>Roos</i>, six Ells apiece; the Earls of <i>Dorset</i>,
with six Barons and five Knights Batchelors, but five
Ells apiece. Afterwards, when the Number of Ells of
Cloth, Garters and Furrs came to be ascertained for each
Degree, all the Knights-Companions (even the Prince
of <i>Wales</i>) were not to exceed five Ells: But since Velvet
came in Plea, the Allowance for Surcoat and Hood
hath been eighteen Yards, when the Surcoat reached
down to the Feet; but now it being the Fashion to
wear it shorter, the Allowance is stinted to Ten. The
Length of King <i>Charles</i> II’s Surcoat was one Yard and
an half, and of the Sleeve one Yard wanting a Nail.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Ornamental Trimmings of these Garments are
next worthy of Note, especially at the Time of Instituting
this Order, for they were then, and a long time
after, powdered all over with little Garters, embroidered
with Silk and Gold-Plate, in each of which was
neatly wrought the Motto, <i>Honi soit, &amp;c.</i> Besides, the
Buckles and Pendants to those small Garters, were
Silver gilt; of these Garters there were no less than
160 upon the first Surcoat and Hood made for the
Founder.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> King <i>Richard</i> II’s Reign, the little Garters that adorned
the Surcoats of the Sovereign, and the other
Knights were wrought in Embroidery upon blue Taffaty
with Cyprus, and Soldat Gold and Silk of divers
Colours, and the Letters Gold. And as the Sovereign
was not limited in the Proportion of Cloth or Velvet
for his Surcoat, no more was he confined to the Number
of Garters, wherewith to adorn it; nor do I find
that any of the Knights-Companions were, until the
Precedent of the Livery of the Garter was settled, for
<i>Anno</i> 1 <i>Henry</i> V. the Dukes of <i>Holland</i> and <i>Clarence</i>, the
Earl of <i>Arundel</i>, the Dukes of <i>Bedford</i> and <i>Gloucester</i> had
each of their Surcoats adorned with 120 Garters, but
the Duke of <i>York</i>, and the rest wore but 100. The
Settlement in the Precedent of the Livery was, in relation
to Degrees of Honour, a greater or less Number
of Garters: Thus,</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>About</span> the Reign of King <i>Henry</i> VI. the Sovereigns
Number of Garters did not much exceed those which
the Founder allow’d to himself at the Institution; for the
Surcoat and Hood of the said King consisted of 173;
and the King of <i>Portugal</i>, <i>Anno</i> 13 <i>Henry</i> VI. 120 Garters.
But this Drapery of their Robes became at length quite
obsolete, perhaps when Cloth was altered to Velvet,
and the plain Surcoat hath to this Day continued in Use.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>While</span> these Surcoats remained of Cloth, they were
lined with Bellies of pure Minever Fur, only the
Sovereigns was purfled with Ermin; and of these, it
seems, a like Proportion was at first stated to all the
Knights-Companions, <i>viz.</i> 200 Bellies. Yet in the
Reign of King <i>Richard</i> II. some Difference began in the
Allowance to the Knights-Companions, for a Baron,
and all Degrees upward had 200 Bellies; but under a Baron
120 only. However, <i>Anno</i> 1. <i>Henry</i> V. the Barons
were tantamount to the Knights-Batchelors, for all Degrees
above a Baron were allow’d, a Fur of 200 Bellies.
But the Barons and Knights-Batchelors Furs were only
120 Bellies.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Afterwards</span>, by the Precedent of the Garter, there
was another Proportion limited, the Prince, a Duke,
a Marquis, an Earl, had each of them Five Timber of
pure Minever allowed to a Surcoat; but the Viscount,
Baron, Baronet and Batchelor-Knights but Three
Timber apiece. In time these Furs were disused, and
the Surcoats came to be lined with white Sarcenet, to
which, <i>temp. Eliz.</i> white Taffaty succeeded, and that
still continues.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>What</span> became of the old Surcoats, since the Knights-Companions
had new ones every Year, the Black Book
of the Order informs us, That on the Eve of the Feast
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>of St. <i>George</i>, the Knights wore to Vespers, the Sovereigns
Livery or Surcoats, used by them the preceding
Year, which after that Night they threw off, (for the
new Surcoats were worn on the Feast-Day); but the
Ensigns and Ornaments of this Kind were disposed of
to the Use of the Colledge.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Hood and Cap comes in the next Place to be
spoken of, which Hood in King <i>Henry</i> VIII’s Statutes,
and the Black Book of the Order is called <i>Humerale</i>;
but in the Rolls of the Great Wardrobe, <i>Capucium</i>.
In the <i>French</i> it is <i>Chaperon</i>, a Word used in the
Statute, <i>Anno</i> 1. <i>Richard</i> II. <i>C.</i> 7. and also retained in
the Old <i>English</i> Copy of <i>Henry</i> VIII’s Statutes made of
his Reign, and annexed to this Treatise. They were
anciently wore for Defence of the Head against the Inclemencies
of Weather, but of later Times Caps and
Hats have supplied their place. How they sat upon the
Head, may be observed in the Portraitures of the first
Founders; as also with some Variety of Fashion in succeeding
Ages: Yet is not the Hood quite thrown by,
since ’tis still kept reclining upon the Back, almost like
a Pilgrim’s Hat.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>This</span> Hood was ordained, and is yet retained as part
of the Habit of this most Noble Order. And tho’
neither it nor the Surcoat is mentioned in the Statutes
of Institution, or in either its Exemplars, nor doth
King <i>Henry</i> V. lay any Stress upon it, yet it is of equal
Antiquity with the rest, as appears from the Rolls of the
great Wardrobe, and <i>Henry</i> VIII’s Statutes have made remarkable
Observation of it, for the Mantle, Surcoat,
Hood, and Collar are called the Habit of the Order: And
in the Black Book, <i>Anno</i> 22. <i>Henry</i> VII. at the Investiture
of <i>Philip</i> King of <i>Castile</i>, the Mantle, Kirtle, Hood
and Collar are expresly called <i>Whole Habit</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>It</span> was heretofore, and now is generally made of the
same Materials as the Surcoat, and was anciently trimmed
and set off with a small Proportion of Garters
lined with Cloth of a different Colour, and such as
would best strike the Sight; but now with Taffaty, as
is the Lining of the Surcoat.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>As</span> to the Cap, which was instituted to succeed the
Hood; it hath been, and yet is, fashioned of black
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>Velvet lin’d with Taffaty; but the Figure hath several
Times varied; for <i>Temp. Henry</i> VIII. it was flat, in
Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>’s Reign it was a little raised in the
Head; but in King <i>James</i>’s Time they were much more
high-crown’d. This Cap hath been usually adorn’d with
Plumes of White Feathers, and Spriggs, and bound about
with a Band set thick with Diamonds; so was
the Cap for the Installation of King <i>Charles</i> II. and
sometimes the Brims have been tack’d up with a large
and costly Jewel.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>This</span> Custom of wearing Caps and Feathers at the
Grand Solemnities of the Order, had, for some Time,
about the Beginning of King <i>James</i> I. Reign, been
omitted, and thereupon, in a Chapter held the 13th of
<i>April</i>, <i>Anno</i> 10. <i>Jac.</i> I. this commendable Custom was
re-establish’d.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>To</span> these may be added the Cross of the Order encompass’d
with a Garter, which by the Sovereign was
ordain’d the 27th of <i>April</i>, 2 <i>Car.</i> I. to be worn upon
the Left Side of the Cloaks, Coats, and riding Cassocks
of the Sovereigns and Knights-Companions, of the
Prelate and Chancellor at all Times, when they were
not adorn’d with their Robes, and in all Places and
Assemblies (but not embellish’d with Pearls and Stones)
that the wearing thereof might be a sufficient Indication
to the World, of that Height of Honour they arriv’d to
from the said most Noble Order, instituted for Persons
of the greatest Merit and Worth.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>And</span> it was not long after e’er the Glory or Star, as
it was usually call’d, having certain Beams of Silver,
that shot out in Form of a Cross, was introduc’d and
annex’d to it, in Imitation (as thought) of the <i>French</i>,
who after the same manner wore the chief Ensign of
the Order of the <i>Holy Ghost</i>, being the Representation
of a Dove irradiated with such like Beams.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>And</span> whereas some Painters affirm the Symbol of the
Holy Ghost to be thus adorn’d congruous enough, yet
censure it improper for a Garter, let them consider that
King <i>Edw.</i> IV. erected his White Rose with the like
Glory, whereof both the Stone Work and Wood Work
of St. <i>George</i>’s Chapel in <i>Windsor</i>, manifestly illustrate,
whose Antiquity makes a Precedent for it long before
<span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>the Institution of the Order of the <i>Holy Ghost</i>; but this
King assum’d this Device upon appearance of three Suns,
which suddenly united together into one immediately,
before his successful Victory at <i>Mortimer</i>’s-<i>Cross</i>, a happy
<i>Æra</i> he thought himself oblig’d to perpetuate. And they
mistake who suppose it to be the Garter that is thus
irradiated, whereas it is something else more worthy
of the Glory, for from it, not the Garter, do the
Rays diffuse, <i>viz.</i> the inclos’d Cross of the Order, celebrated
as glorious, since it darted its bright Beams from
Heaven, when it appear’d to <i>Constantine the Great</i>; as
the same is represented on a Silver Medal: On the one
Side whereof was a <i>Bust in profile</i>, or side Face of King
<i>Charles</i> I. and on the Reverse, this Badge of the Order,
within a Garter, inscrib’d, <i>Honi</i>, &amp;c. a Cross irradiated,
dispersing its Beams in a Rhombular Form of Eight
Angles, beyond the Orbit or bounding Lines of the said
Garter, having for Circumscription, <i>Prisci decus Ordinis
Auctum</i>, 1629.</p>

<p class='c008'>§ 5. <span class='sc'>Having</span> finish’d our Discourse concerning the
Robes of the Order, we shall speak of the Robes and
Hoods assign’d to the Queen, Knights-Companions
Wives, and other great Ladies, by the Donation of the
Sovereigns, set off and embellished with Minute Garters,
and lin’d with Rich Furs, which Robes they were
adorn’d with during the Solemnity of the Feast of
St. <i>George</i>, a Custom almost as ancient as its Institution.
The first Mention we find recorded of the Feminine
Habit occurs, <i>Anno</i> 7. <i>R.</i> II. when the Queen, the
Sovereign’s Mother, the Dutchess of <i>Lancaster</i>, the
Countesses of <i>Cambridge</i>, <i>Buckingham</i>, <i>Pembroke</i>, <i>Oxford</i>,
and <i>Salisbury</i>, the Ladies <i>Philippa</i> and <i>Catherine</i>,
Daughters to the Duke of <i>Lancaster</i>, and the Lady
<i>Mohun</i> had such kind of Robes and Hoods provided
for them. They were made of Cloth, Violet in Grain,
like as the Sovereign and Knights-Companions that
Year, the Robes lin’d with Fur, but the Hoods with
Scarlet, and both embroidered over with little Garters,
and the Proportion of Cloth, Furs, and Garters, were
stated according to their several Ranks and Degrees;
for the Queen had Eight Ells, and Half an Ell of
<span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>Scarlet for the Lining of her Hood. The Sovereign’s
Mother had allow’d her one whole Piece, and a double
Proportion of Scarlet; but from the large Quantity it
is conceiv’d she had Two Robes and Hoods made at this
time: Besides, the particular Number are but Eleven
Persons, and cannot else reach the Total of the Robes
that were made up and expressly set down to be Twelve.
The Dutchess of <i>Lancaster</i> had the Allowance of Half
a Piece, and Half an Ell of Scarlet; the Countess of
<i>Cambridge</i> Seven Ells of Cloth and Half an Ell of
Scarlet, and the rest of the Ladies the same Proportion of
Cloth with the Knights-Companions, <i>i. e.</i> each Five
Ells a-piece, and Half an Ell of Scarlet. According to
their Cloth was also their Proportion of Minever; the
Queen’s Allowance was Two Furs, each containing
Three Hundred Bellies of pure Minever; the Sovereign’s
Mother had twice that Proportion, the Dutchess
of <i>Lancaster</i>, and Countess of <i>Cambridge</i> had the same
Allowance as the Queen; but all the rest of the
Ladies had only one Fur of Two Hundred Bellies.
Besides the embroidered Garters to deck out the
Twenty-four Surcoats of the Sovereign and Knights-Companions,
and the Twelve Robes for the Queen,
and other Ladies, amounted to the Number of
2900.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Against</span> the Feast of St. <i>George</i>, <i>Anno.</i> 11. <i>R.</i> II.
there were prepared Fifteen Robes and Hoods for the
Queen and other Ladies, of the same Livery and suit
with the Sovereign and Knights-Companions, <i>viz.</i>
White long Cloth, and Blue Cloth for the Lining of
their Hoods, bearing the same Proportion in all Things
as the former, <i>Anno</i> 13. <i>Rich.</i> II. the Ladies Robes
and Hoods were Sanguine Cloth, and the Lining of
their Hoods Cloth in Grain. And in the 19th <i>Rich.</i> II.
they were Blue Cloth, and long Cloth in Grain for
Lining their Hoods. In both these Years we find the
Dutchess of <i>Aquitaine</i> had double the Proportion of
Cloth allow’d her (as had also the Dutchess of <i>York</i>)
<i>viz.</i> Fourteen Ells, (the Queen having then but the
former Allowance of Eight Ells) and yet her Proportion
of Lining, both for the Robe and Hood, was no more
than allow’d the Queen.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span><span class='sc'>But</span> <i>Anno</i> 1 <i>Henry</i> V. the same Quantities of Cloth,
Minevers, and Garters, were the same to Ladies of all
Degrees, and that was to each Five Ells of White
Woollen Cloth, only the Queen-Mother had Eight
Ells of White Cloth and Eight Ells of Black Cloth, a
Fee containing Two Hundred Bellies of Minever, and
an Hundred embroidered Garters, and 12 <i>Henry</i> VI. the
Master of the great Wardrobe was commanded to make
ready the like Livery, both for Colour of Cloth,
number of Ells, Bellies of Minever, and Garters, for
the Countess of <i>Suffolk</i>, against the approaching Feast
of St. <i>George</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>A plainer Narrative is made of these Liveries, <i>Anno</i>
16 <i>Edw.</i> IV. when at the Feast of St. <i>George</i> at <i>Windesor</i>,
the Queen, the Lady <i>Elizabeth</i>, the King’s Daughter,
and Dutchess of <i>Suffolk</i>, the King’s Sister, had for their
Livery Murrey Gowns embroidered with Garters.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Besides</span> these Robes worn by the Ladies at the Festivals
of the Order, there seems to be some Imitation
of wearing a Garter also on their Left Arms, as the
Knights did on their Left Leg, as it is observ’d on the
Countess of <i>Tankervile</i>’s Monument, where she is so
pourtray’d.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>After</span> a long Disuse of these Robes, <i>Anno</i> 14 <i>Car.</i> I.
there was an endeavour to restore it; for the Deputy
Chancellor sollicited the Sovereign in Chapter, That
the Ladies of the Knights-Companions might be
granted the Privilege to wear a Garter of the Order about
their Arms, and an upper Robe at Festival Times,
according to ancient Usage, upon which Motion the
Sovereign gave Order that the Queen’s Pleasure
should be known herein, and the Affair left to the
Ladies particular Request, and the Year ensuing, upon
the Deputy Chancellor’s Report at another Chapter at
<i>Windesor</i>, it was then left to a Chapter to be called by
the Knights-Companions, to preponderate of every
Circumstance, how it were fittest to be effected for the
Honour and Lustre of the Order; which was appointed
to be held at <i>London</i> about <i>All-hollantide</i> next;
But the unhappy War breaking out, this Matter entirely
broke off.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span>§ 6. <span class='sc'>There</span> remains now the Collar and <i>George</i>,
brought in by King <i>Henry</i> VIII. And first, of Collars in
general, which is an Ornament not of late, but ancient
Invention, and the wonderful Consent of most Nations
plead for it: Sacred Writ sets down the Collar of Gold
for one of the Ornaments <i>Pharaoh</i> conferr’d upon <i>Joseph</i>.
The Images of <i>Isis</i> and <i>Osiris</i> were represented with such
like Collars, in a manner, extending to their Shoulders,
as <i>Kircher</i> informs us. Their Workmanship seems wonderfully
curious, being intersected with various Lines,
and divided with Tablets and precious Stones. The
Collar was of an illustrious Original among the <i>Romans</i>,
and gave Denomination to the Family of <i>Torquati</i>, descended
from <i>L. Manlius</i>, whom the Soldiers surnam’d
<i>Torquatus</i>, because he fought with a Champion of the
<i>Gauls</i>, <i>Anno V. C.</i> 392. and, having foil’d him in fight,
cut off his Head, and then pluck’d off his Collar,
bloody as it was, and put it about his own Neck. In
further Memory of which Action were found several
<i>Roman</i> Coins referring to <i>L. Torquatus</i>, Consul with
<i>L. Cotta</i>, <i>Anno V. C.</i> 688. And it’s remarkable that
when one of another Tribe was adopted into this Family,
he did also assume this Badge of Honour, as in
the Coin of <i>D. Junius Silanus</i>, tho’ the Fashion of the
Work somewhat differ’d from the former.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> pristine Times none but Kings and Princes wore
Collars, and therefore their Use seems of Dignity and
Power, as is evident from <i>Daniel</i>, where the <i>Assyrian</i>
Kings used this Ornament. Afterwards Men famous for
Wisdom and Council, had them as a distinguishing
Badge, as in the Example of <i>Joseph</i>, and from the Proclamation
of <i>Belshazzar</i> King of <i>Babylon</i>, who proposed
it as a Præmium to him that could interpret the Hand-Writing
upon the Wall. And Men famous for Military
Atchievements had it conferr’d upon them, in Recompence
of their Merits; thus Collars were of the
Number of the <i>Dona &amp; Præmia Militaria</i> among <a id='the' name='the'></a>the
<i>Romans</i>, and the Honour of receiving them thought worthy
to be consign’d to Posterity in Marble Inscriptions.
From them the later Emperors receiv’d it, and we read
of investing a Knight of the <i>Holy Sepulchre</i> with a
<span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>Collar at his Creation; where, as soon as the Ceremony
of his Ordination is over, the Padre Guardian Kisses the
new Made Knight, and puts about his Neck (according
to the mode of the Ancients) a Golden Collar, with a
Cross hanging at it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Most</span> aptly therefore have the Sovereigns of Military
Orders annex’d this Ornament of the Collar to their
Habit, and conferr’d it on the Fellows and Companions,
many of whom have meritoriously deserv’d it for their
great Wisdom and valorous Exploits, and for this reason
it was instituted in additional Glory to the Ensigns
of the Garter, compos’d in a peculiar manner, in Relation
to the Name and Title; to the wearing of which
the Sovereign oblig’d both himself and Knights-Companions,
and his and their Successors.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>This</span> Collar was ordain’d to be of Gold Thirty
Ounces Troy weight, but not to exceed it; howbeit that
Collar sent to <i>Gustavus Adolphus</i>, King of <i>Sweden</i>,
weigh’d Thirty-four Ounces and a Quarter, and that of
King <i>Charles</i> I. 35 Ounces and an Half; which, after
his Sufferings, fell into the Hands of <i>Thomas Harrison</i>,
one of <i>Oliver</i>’s Major-Generals, and was by him delivered
to the Trustees for Sale of the King’s Goods:
They, 1649. sent it to the <i>Mint</i>, with divers of the
<i>Regalia</i>, to set the Stamp on work for the first Gold
that the upstart Common-wealth coin’d.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>It</span> was appointed by King <i>Henry</i> VIII’s Statutes, that
this Collar should be compos’d of Pieces of Gold
in Fashion of Garters, the Ground enamelled Blue,
and the Letters of the Motto Gold; in the midst of
each Garter, Two Roses plac’d, the innermost enamelled
Red, and the outermost White, contrarily in the
next Garter, the innermost Rose enamelled White,
and the outermost Red, and so alternately; but of
later Times these Roses are wholly Red.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Number of these Garters are so many as be the
ordain’d Number of the Sovereign and Knights-Companions;
at the Institution they were Twenty-six, being
fasten’d together with as many Knots of Gold, and
this Mode hitherto has continu’d invariable; nor
ought the Collar to be adorn’d or enrich’d with precious
Stones, (as the <i>George</i> may be) such being prohibited
by the Law of the Order.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span><span class='sc'>At</span> the Middle of the Collar before pendant, at the
Table of one of the Garters in the Collar is to be fix’d
the Image of St. <i>George</i> arm’d sitting on Horseback, who
having thrown the Dragon on his Back encounters him
with a Tilting-Spear. This Jewel is not encompass’d
with a Garter or Row of Diamonds, as in the lesser
<i>George</i>; but in round Relief. It is allow’d to be beautified
and sett off with Diamonds and other Enrichments,
at the Pleasure of the Knight-Companion who possessed
it, and upon that Score it hath been frequently adorn’d
with Variety of costly Work, whereon the Diamonds,
and other precious Stones, being set to that Advantage
as might, upon its Motion and Agitation, dart forth a
resplendent Lustre.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Before</span> the Establishment of this Article by King
<i>Henry</i> VIII. it appears that the Knights-Companions
were invested with Collars at their Installations, for
the Black Book makes mention of a Collar among the
Ensigns of the Garter, wherewith <i>Philip</i> King of <i>Castile</i>
was invested, <i>Anno</i> 22 <i>Henry</i> VII. but whether a Collar
of SS’s, or of another Model, is not specifi’d: Nevertheless
this Scruple is in part clear’d up by an old Memorial
of the Ceremonies, at the Creating <i>Henry</i> Lord
<i>Stafford</i> Earl of <i>Wiltshire</i>, 1 <i>Henry</i> VIII. where it is said
in the Annals, that after he was invested with the Robes
of his State and Dignity, the Collar of the Garter was
put about his Neck at constituting him a Knight of the
Order. And to make it more conspicuous in a Vellum
Book of the Statutes sent to <i>Maximilian</i> the Emperor,
sign’d 1508. by the Register <i>T. Rowthale</i>, and in another
of <i>Edward Stanley</i> Lord <i>Monteagle</i>, elected <i>ann.</i> 6. <i>Hen.</i> VIII.
the Forty First Article, enjoins a Collar to be worn
by each Knight-Companion expresly called the Collar
of the Order, which tho’ it be not in all Respects
consentient to that prescribed by King <i>Henry</i> VIII’s Statutes,
yet there is not much Variation, and ’tis reported
to be a <i>Gold Collar coupled together by several Pieces of Links,
in Fashion of Garters, with a Vermilion Rose, and the Image
of St.</i> George <i>hung thereat</i>. The Reason of the Knights-Companions
wearing it at the Times appointed, the
License for putting it to mending, the Command not
<span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>to enrich the Collar, but the <i>George</i> only; and under a
Penalty not to sell, pawn or alienate it upon any Necessity
whatsoever, are wholly the same as was afterwards enjoyn’d
by King <i>Henry</i> VIII. So that he did but only
annex to his Body of Statutes a Decree, which for the
greatest part had been put in practise before. In the
11th <i>Hen.</i> VIII. upon Interpretation of the Eleventh
Article of the Statutes, the Collar is there enumerated
as part of the entire Robes that a Knight-Companion is
oblig’d to wear, for a more convincing Proof, That
the Collar of Garters was used before King <i>Henry</i> VIII’s
Reign, the Monument of Sir <i>Giles Daubeny</i> plainly Delineates
(who departed 22 <i>Henry</i> VII.) in <i>Westminster-Abbey</i>,
where his Portraicture in the Robes of the Order
is adorned with such a Collar as King <i>Henry</i> VIII’s
Statutes do afterwards describe.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>As</span> the Garter sent to <i>Gustavus Adolphus</i> King of <i>Sweden</i>,
so the great <i>George</i> (pendant at his Collar weighing
Seven Ounces) was set with large and resplendent Diamonds,
to the Number of Eighty-Four.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> what Regard this Noble Ensign of Honour the
Collar, hath been with the Sovereigns and Knights-Companions,
not only of the Order of the <i>Garter</i>, but
other Military Orders, may be collected from the
Pictures of some of them, as well as from their Seals,
Coins, and Medals, for in these they have been pleased
to exhibit their Effigies and Escutcheons of Arms; and
omitting Foreign Examples, the Collars, both of the
<i>Garter</i> and <i>Thistle</i>, were express’d in the Coronation Medal
of King <i>Charles</i> I. in <i>Scotland</i>, 1633. tho’ in that of
his Coronation at <i>Westminster</i>, and afterwards in that of
King <i>Charles</i> II. 1661. the Collar of the Order of the
<i>Garter</i> are only put over their Royal Robes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>These</span> Ornaments of the Collars, have been affix’d
sometimes encircling the Shields of their Arms; and in
a Seal of <i>Charles the Bold</i> Duke of <i>Burgundy</i>, Sovereign
of the Order of the <i>Golden Fleece</i>, plac’d to an Instrument
dated, 1470. it is worthy of Remark, that
Collar adorns the Neck of the Lyon of <i>Flanders</i>; but
the Sovereigns of the <i>Garter</i> usually encompass’d their
Arms, not within the Collar of the Order, but the
Royal Garter, that being its principal Ensign; and
<span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>sometimes, having no Shield of Arms, the void Space
within the Garter, exhibits their Arms.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Observable</span> is the Seal of <i>Charles</i> Count <i>Palatine</i> of
the <i>Rhine</i>, wherein is a Shield quarterly of the <i>Palatinate</i>
and <i>Bavaria</i>, obscuring the Lyon Guardant its Supporter,
his Four SS’s only appearing quadrangularly, and his
Head a top ensign’d with an Electoral Crown; this
Shield is encircled both within the Garter and Collar of
the Order, and is the first Example wherein both these
Ensigns are jointly together. It is very frequent to express
the Collars of different Orders together: Thus I
have seen the Arms of <i>Robert Dudley</i> Earl of <i>Leicester</i>,
entour’d within the Garter, and a Collar of the Order
of St. <i>Michael</i>, having been Knight of these Orders,
and the Funeral Atchievement of the late <i>James Hamilton
Douglas</i> Duke of <i>Hamilton</i>, had the Garter and a Collar
of the Thistle about it. And in a Plate under the Effigies
of the Duke of <i>Aspernons</i>, a Shield of his Arms
quarter’d, is encompass’d with the chiefest Ensigns of
those Three Orders, whereof he was a Brother and
Companion, <i>viz.</i> with the Garter and the Collars of
St. <i>Michael</i> and the <i>Holy Ghost</i>. And the older the Order
is in the Roll of Antiquity, whose chief Ensign is there
represented, the nearer ought it to be plac’d to the
Escutcheon of Arms, being the more Honourable Post.
A Mistake was committed in the marshalling these Collars,
when the Duke of <i>Chevereux</i> affixed it over his Stall
at <i>Windsor</i>, the Collars of St. <i>Mithael</i> and the <i>Holy Ghost</i>
are plac’d nearer to his Escutcheon than that of the
Garter.</p>

<p class='c000'>§ 8. <span class='sc'>And</span> whereas we have spoke of another kind of
Collar, call’d a Collar of SS’s, worn as Badges of lower
and inferior Honour, it will not be amiss to inform our
Judgment in other Affairs concerning them. <i>Wicelius</i>
informs us from a Book in the Library of <i>Fulda</i>, where
(in the Life of the Two Brothers <i>Simplicius</i> and <i>Faustinus</i>,
both Senators, and suffer’d Martyrdom under <i>Dioclesian</i>)
there is a Description of the Society of St. <i>Simplicius</i>,
consisting of Noble Personages in their own Families,
and describing the Collar wore as the Badge of it
says, thus: <i>It was the Custom of those Persons to wear about
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>their Necks Silver Collars, compos’d of double SS’s, which denote
the Name of Saint</i> Simplicius, <i>between these double SS’s.
The Collar consisted of Twelve small Plates of Silver, in
which were engraven the Twelve Articles of the Creed, together
with a single Trefoil: The Image of St.</i> Simplicius
<i>hung at the Collar, and from it Seven Plates, representing the
Seven Gifts of the Holy Ghost. As to the manner of their
Martyrdom, they were bound together by the Neck to a Stone,
and thrown over the Bridge into the River</i> Tyber.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>At</span> what Time the Collar of SS’<i>s</i> came into <i>England</i> is
not fully determin’d, but it will appear at least Three
Hundred Years since, and worn as an Ornament for
Women, as well as Men; for on a Monument in the
Collegiate Church of <i>Warwick</i>, the Figure of <i>Margaret</i>,
Wife to Sir <i>William Peito</i> (said to be interr’d <i>Temp.
Edw.</i> III.) hath a Collar of SS’<i>s</i> drawn about, and set
close to her Neck, which the Sculpture in <i>The Antiquities
of</i> Warwickshire, by mistake, represented like a
Ruff. There was also a Collar of SS’<i>s</i> about the Neck
of Sir <i>Simon Burley</i>’s Statue in St. <i>Paul</i>’s <i>London</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> the ancient Creation of an Esquire in <i>England</i>,
part of the Ceremony was the King’s putting about his
Neck a Silver Collar of SS’<i>s</i>. And <i>Selden</i>, in his Titles
of Honour contemns not the old Ballad, <i>The Tanner of</i>
Tamworth, to prove the Creation of Esquires in King
<i>Edw.</i> IV’s Reign, by conferring such Collars on them.
But that the Golden one was the undoubted Badge of
a Knight, as may be instanc’d by many undeniable Examples,
deduc’d from the Monuments of such Persons,
<i>Temp. Hen.</i> VI. <i>Ed.</i> IV. <i>Hen.</i> VII. <i>Hen.</i> VIII. and since, and
so legally appropriate thereto, that in the Act 24 <i>H.</i> VIII.
made for Reformation of Apparel, there is a Proviso
entred, That Knights, notwithstanding, might publickly
wear a Gold Collar of SS’<i>s</i>, tho’ since it is grown
obsolete and useless. <i>Favin</i> tells us that our <i>Hen.</i> V. instituted
an Order surnam’d Knights of the SS’<i>s</i> on the
Day of the Martyrs St. <i>Crispine</i> and <i>Crispianus</i>; which
tho’ he found nothing of it in our <i>English</i> Historians,
yet from the Chronicle of <i>Juvenal des Ursins</i>, where he
treats of the Battle of <i>Agincourt</i>, he collected this following
Relation.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>“<span class='sc'>The</span> King of <i>England</i> exhorted his Men, and
commanded, That if any had trespass’d against another,
they should be reconcil’d and confess’d to the
Priests, otherwise no good Success wou’d accrew to
them in their Attempts. He advis’d them to be
civil in their March, and to do their Duty well, and
agreed upon these Conditions, That those of their
Company who were not of gentle Extraction he
wou’d make so from the Fountain of Honour, and
give them Warrants, that for the future they should
enjoy the Privileges the Gentlemen of <i>England</i> had;
and to the End they might be distinguish’d from others,
he granted them leave to wear a Collar
powder’d with the Letter S.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Among</span> the Variety of Collars of SS’s now in vogue,
there are these following: The Lord Mayor of <i>London</i>’s
Collar is compos’d of Gold, having a Knot (like one
of those that tye the Garters together in the great Collar
of the Order) inserted between Two SS<i>s</i>, and they
again situated between Two Roses, <i>viz.</i> a White Rose
within a Red, and in the Middle before the Breast is
a large Portcullis, whereat hangs a most rich Jewel sett
with large Diamonds.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Collars of the Lords Chief Justices of both the
Benches, and the chief Baron of the <i>Exchequer</i>, are
(in Memory of the said St. <i>Simplicius</i>, a Senator, and
consequently a Gownman) form’d of the Letter S, and
a Knot alternately, having a Rose set in that part of it
which falls out to be in the Middle of their Breasts, and
another on their Backs; the Five Flowers of these Roses
are constituted of Five large Pearls.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Those</span> Collars, which appertain to the Kings and
Heralds of Arms, as well as to Serjeants at Arms, having
been bestow’d by former Kings, and renew’d to
them by King <i>Charles</i> II. to be worn upon Days of solemn
Attendance, are compos’d of SS’s link’d together.
In the Middle of the Breast is a Rose, at each of which
hangs Three small Drops of Silver; but the SS’s in
the Collars worn by the Kings of Arms are made
somewhat larger than the other, and in that part lying
on either Shoulder, is a Portcullis taken in between
the SS’s, which are wanting in the rest.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span><span class='sc'>The</span> general difference of the Collars appropriate to
the before-named Degrees, is this; Knights have allow’d
them Collars of Silver gilt, but Esquires only Silver;
and therefore in the Creating of an Herald, in part of
that Ceremony, he is made an Esquire, by putting on
him a Collar of SS’s of Silver; and so is a Serjeant at
Arms.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Kings of <i>England</i> have sometimes been pictured
with a Collar of SS’s about their Arms, in like manner
as the Garter doth surround them, as appears from an
Impression of King <i>Henry</i> VIII’s Privy Signet; whereon
his Royal Arms crown’d are encircled with a Collar of
SS’s, to the lower End of which are affix’d Two Portcullisses.</p>

<p class='c008'>§ 9. <span class='sc'>We</span> come now to the lesser <i>George</i> of the Order;
and we do not find that the Effigies of St. <i>George</i> was at
any time worn by the Sovereign or Knights-Companions,
before the Breast or under the Arm, as now
used till the 13th of <i>Henry</i> VIII. But then that King
decreed in a Chapter held at <i>Greenwich</i>, the Morrow after
St. <i>George</i>’s Day, That every Knight should wear loosely
before his Breast the Image of St. <i>George</i> in a Gold
Chain, or otherwise, in a Ribband, the same to be
fasten’d within the ennobled Garter, for a manifest
Distinction between the Knights-Companions, and others
of the Nobility and Knights, who, according to
the Mode of those Times, wore large Gold Chains,
the ordinary Ensigns of Knighthood. And thus the
wearing the Medal or Jewel, usually call’d the lesser
<i>George</i>, to distinguish it from the other Work at the
Collar of the Order, first receiv’d the Injunction, and
hath since been frequently used.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>This</span> <i>George</i> was, for the most part, pure Gold curiously
wrought, but divers of them were exquisitely
graved in Onyx’s and Agats, and with such a happy
Collection of the Stones, that heightned and received
their Beauty by the Skill of the Artificer, in contriving
the Figures and History, the natural Tincture of the
Stones have so fitted them with Colours for Flesh, Hair,
and every thing else, even to Surprize and Admiration.
In this Jewel is St. <i>George</i> represented in a Riding
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>Posture encountring the Dragon with his drawn
Sword.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>By</span> the last Article of King <i>Henry</i> VIII’s. Statutes, it
was allowed to be enriched at the Pleasure of the Possessor,
(as is the great George) which for the most Part
hath been curiously enamell’d, and the Garter about it
sett with Diamonds. And of what weight and bigness
these lesser <i>George</i>’s were, may be gather’d from that
sent to the French King <i>Charles</i> IX. being an Ounce and
an half and half quarter Weight. The Variety of
Workmanship in those Gold Chains whereat this Jewel
hung, was usually great, according to the Fancy and
Pleasure of the Persons for whom they were wrought.
But within a short Space, wearing the lesser George in
Silk-Ribbands, as well as Gold-Chains, was promiscuously
us’d and <i>ad Libitum</i>. (So were the Symbols of Foreign
Orders, as divers Coins and Medals declare.) But
the Colour of these Ribbands when they came first to be
wore, was black. <i>John Dudley</i> Viscount <i>Lisle</i>, the Lords
St. <i>John</i> and <i>Parr</i>, so used them at their Investiture,
35 <i>Henry</i> VIII. and several Pictures of other Knights-Companions
about that time confirm the same. That
small Chain whereat hung the lesser <i>George</i> transmitted
to <i>Emanuel</i> of <i>Savoy</i>, <i>Ann.</i> 1 &amp; 2 <i>Ph.</i> &amp; <i>Mar.</i> was formed
of twelve Pieces of Gold, in every of which was sett
three small Diamonds, and of twelve other like Pieces,
wherein were three Rubies and twenty four Pearls.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>It</span> appears by a Letter of Sir <i>Richard</i> St. <i>George</i>, Kt.
<i>Clarencieux</i>, dated <i>July</i> 10th, 1627. that the blue Ribband
had some Years before been additional to the Ornament
of the Order; and ’tis reported, that <i>Robert</i> Earl of
<i>Essex</i> observing in <i>France</i> the Jewels of the Order of
St. <i>Michael</i> and St. <i>Esprit</i> worn in blue Ribbands, upon
his return was the principal motive those Ribbands
whereat the <i>George</i> hung, were exchanged into that
Colour. And in a Picture of Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>, drawn
towards the Declension of her Reign, her lesser George
is represented hanging before her Breast in a blue Ribband.
And this Colour was more caressed, and grew in
great repute, by reason it was the Ground of the Garter,
and nearest the Colour of the Mantle of the Order:
So that toward the latter End of the Reign of King
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span><i>James</i> I. because the dye of the Ribband had not been
peculiarly express’d in any Statute, and the blue and
azure accustomed for some Years past, it was decreed,
That for the future it should be always of blue,
and no other; nor in time of Mourning it self, should
be changed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Manner of wearing this Ribband in time of
Peace, was of later Times pendant about the Neck,
down to the Middle of the Breast, where the lesser
George hung; but since, for the more Conveniency of
Riding or Action, the same is spread over the left
Shoulder, and brought under the right Arm where the
Jewel hangs.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>But</span> where the Pictures of the Sovereign and Knights-Companions
are drawn in Armour, there even to this
Day the George is represented as fix’d to a Gold Chain
instead of a blue Ribband, and worn about the Neck,
not brought under the right Arm, as exhibited on the
three Pound Pieces of Gold stamped at <i>Oxford</i> by King
<i>Charles</i> I. 1643. and a Medal of <i>Charles</i> Count Palatine
of the <i>Rhine</i>, dated 1645.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> George King <i>Charles</i> I. had at his Martyrdom, was
curiously Engraved in an Onyx set about with twenty
One large Table-Diamonds in the Fashion of a Garter.
On the reverse of the said George was the Picture of the
Queen set in a Case of Gold, the Lid neatly enamell’d
with Goldsmith’s Work, and surrounded with another
Garter adorned with an equal Number of Diamonds, as
<span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span>was that of King <i>Charles</i> II. also sett with fair Diamonds;

of their Countries or Families; such as the Emperors
of <i>Russia</i>, the Dukes of <i>Mantua</i>, and the Counts

demonstrate.</p>

<p class='c008'>§ 10. <i>When the Habit or part of it ought to be worn is the
next thing we shall speak of.</i></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> more solemn Days and Occasions which require
a fuller conformity, and the wearing the whole Habit,
<i>i. e.</i> the Garter, Mantle, Surcoat, Hood, Collar, Great
George, and Cap, are first, The High Festival of the
Order, commonly called St. <i>George</i>’s Feast, whether it
be solemnized on the 22d, 23d or 24th of <i>April</i>, annually,
or any other Days within the Year by Prorogation, as is
apparent by all the Bodies of the Statutes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>For</span>, First it is ordained, That the Knights-Companions
should be Arrayed in the whole Habit on the Eve
of St. <i>George</i>, before the Sovereign proceeded to the
Chapter to hear Divine Service, and being so Robed,
should attend on the Sovereign to the Chapter-House,
thence to the Chapel, and return with him back in
the same manner, until after Supper, as well those that
minded to Sup, as those that should not Sup; nor
might they disrobe, until the Sovereign or his Deputy
had put off his, or declar’d it seasonable for his or their
doing so.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>By</span> the same Statute they were enjoined to wear the
whole Habit on the Feast of St. <i>George</i>, both at their
Progression in the Morning to the Chapter-House or
Chapel, at their return to Dinner from thence to the
Second Vespers, and back to Supper, as also till Supper
was over, and until the Sovereign or his Lieutenant took
leave of the rest of the Knights-Companions.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span><i>Secondly</i>, <span class='sc'>It</span> is manifest from King <i>Henry</i> VIII’s Statutes,
That the Eve, the Day of St. <i>George</i>, and Morrow
following, were to be observed with solemn Service,
and holding of Chapters wheresoever the Sovereign
was resident; tho’ the Grand Feast were Prorogued
to a longer Duration; and when by reason of such Prorogation,
they should convene in any Place besides
<i>Windsor</i> to attend the Sovereign for the Solemnization
of St. <i>George</i>’s Day, they then must Adorn themselves
with the whole Habit from beginning of the first Vespers,
until the last Evening Service of the same Day.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Thirdly</i>, <span class='sc'>On</span> such other Days of the Year whereon the
Grand Feast is held by Prorogation, and during such
Part of the Eve and Day of the Feast, as is before appointed
when it is held on its proper Day.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Fourthly</i>, <span class='sc'>By</span> absent Knights, whensoever the Grand
Feast of St. <i>George</i> should be celebrated, and wheresoever
they should happen at that time to reside, (if at
Liberty, and not under restraint) to keep it in like
manner as if then present with the Sovereign, or his
Deputy in the Place where he should Celebrate the
Feast. The time of wearing the whole Habit in this
Point extends but to the End of the second Vespers, as
in the second Instance above.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Fifthly</i>, <span class='sc'>The</span> Knights-Companions are to wear the
entire Habit at the Feasts of Installation when they
assist at that Ceremony; where, if it commence in the
Evening, they are not to disrobe themselves till after
Supper; and being the next Morning habited as before,
then to proceed to the Chapter-House or Chapel,
and not to devest themselves till Dinner is ended.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> less solemn Occasions are those, which require
the wearing the Mantle or Collar of the Order only.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>And</span> they are first, upon the Morrow after the Grand
Feast-Day, when the Sovereign and Knights-Companions
proceed to the Chapel, and make their Offering; then it
sufficeth, that they barely put on the Mantle, which,
Service being Finished, they were wont to leave it at the
Chapter-House-Door as they retired out of the Chapel.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Secondly</i>, <span class='sc'>As</span> often as Chapters are called, and in what
Place soever assembled, either for Elections, or other
Causes, as it shall please the Sovereign to nominate:
<span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>And as often as it is requisite for the Sovereign, or any
of the Knights-Companions to enter into the Chapel of
St. <i>George</i> at <i>Windsor</i>; and in reference hereunto, is the
Article 15 <i>E.</i> 3. was that their Mantles should remain in
the Vestry at <i>Windsor</i>, that upon any sudden emergency,
they might be in readiness: for in the Inventory of the
Chapel taken 8 <i>R.</i> 2. we find remaining at that
time in the Vestry, a Mantle appertaining to the Sovereign,
another to <i>John</i> Duke of <i>Britain</i>, a third to <i>John
Holland</i> Earl of <i>Huntington</i>, another to <i>Edmund Langley</i>
Earl of <i>Cambridge</i>, and one to <i>Thomas Holland</i>, Earl of
<i>Kent</i>, all of them then surviving: And by a Decree past
at the Grand Feast 1 <i>H.</i> 6. the Mantle of the young
Sovereign was appointed to be left at <i>Windsor</i>, as the
Statutes required; and this Article was confirmed by
King <i>Henry</i> VIII. by Virtue whereof, the Mantles of the
Emperor <i>Charles</i> V. and <i>Anna</i> Duke of <i>Montmorency</i>, were
left in the Custody of the Dean and Canons of <i>Windsor</i>.
And heretofore in the Bill of drawing up Matters necessary
for the Installation of a Knight-Companion, there
were usually two Mantles set down; one expressed to
be left in the College, and the other for all other Occasions
that might intervene.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>These</span> Mantles thus ordered to be reposed in the
College upon emergent Occasions, were anciently committed
to the Custody of the Black-Rod, as granted by
Letters Patent with the Office 1 <i>H.</i> 5. And after the
Death of the Owners, devolved to the Dean and Canons
of <i>Windsor</i>, either for the publick Use of the Knights-Companions
when they casually came to <i>Windsor</i>, or
else sold sometimes to the Heirs of the Deceased, or
others who succeeded in the Order, as that of <i>Charles</i> V.
was to the Earl of <i>Bedford</i>, and that of the Constable of
<i>France</i> lent to the Earl of <i>Warwick</i>, <i>Ann.</i> 7 <i>Eliz.</i> which
appears from the Accounts of the Chanter of the
College, <i>temp. H.</i> 4. <i>H.</i> 5. <i>H.</i> 8. Q. <i>Eliz.</i> and <i>Jac.</i> 1. who
in all times answered the full Benefit thereof to the
College, as being a certain Perquisite to the Dean and
Canons, which they accordingly had and enjoyed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>And</span> yet we find some of the College made over-bold
with the Robe of <i>Sigismond</i> the Emperour, and sold
it while he surviv’d. But the Archbishop of <i>York</i>, who,
<span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>as Chancellor of <i>England</i>, visited the College, 1431.
secured the Money from being distributed among
those that sold it, and reserved the Dividend to the
Dean and Chapter that should chance to be living at
that Emperour’s Expiration; and commanded for the
Future under Pain of Excommunication, That no Dean
and Canon should imbezil or aliene any Knights-Companion’s
Mantle while he was alive, but the same should
be decently and faithfully kept and preserved. But we
are informed, that this Statute was altered, <i>Ann.</i> 9 <i>Eliz.</i>
and one drawn up to this effect, <i>That the Knights-Companions
should be bound by Oath to take care by their Wills,
that after their Decease, all the Ornaments which they had
received should be restored, the Robes to the College, and the
Jewels to the Sovereign that gave them</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> the last Place, the Times of wearing the Collar of
the Order, with the Great <i>George</i> appendant, which is
not only enjoined to be worn (as part of the Habit) at
the grand Feasts and Feasts of Installation, but also at
other times when not any of the rest of the Habit is
ordered (saving the Garter) is to be worn, as in special,
<i>at the principal and solemn Feasts of the Year</i>, and other
Feast-Days: To which a particular Order in Chapter,

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Besides</span> these, the Sovereigns and Knights-Companions
have been accustomed to wear this Ensign upon
the Anniversary of the Sovereign’s Coronation, of the
<i>Gun-Powder Treason</i>, and, of later Times, on the Sovereign’s
Birth-day: So formerly upon some occasional
Ceremonies not relative to the Order; as when a Knight-Companion
hath been created into Titles of Dignity and
Honour, he had the Collar of the Garter added to his
<span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>Investiture, as appears in the Case of <i>Henry Stafford</i>, created
Earl of <i>Wiltshire</i>, <i>Ann.</i> 1 <i>Hen.</i> 8. And at a Chapter
held <i>May</i> 22d. 1622. That such Knights-Companions as
should afterwards assist at the Funeral of any Knight-Companion,
should wear the Collar <i>apert</i> at the said
Funeral. And it was so observed by the Dukes of <i>Ormond</i>
and <i>Richmond</i>, the Earls of <i>Manchester</i> and <i>Sandwich</i>,
at the Obsequies of <i>George Monk</i> Duke of <i>Albemarle</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Howbeit, the Custom is otherwise as to wearing the
Garter, the principal Ensign of the Order; for tho’ it
be injoyned to be wore at the grand Festivals, <i>&amp;c.</i> yet
it does not imply that it might be left off: For indeed
it ought daily to be worn both by the Sovereign and
Knights Companions. And therefore was it decreed
even in its Institution, That if any Knight-Companion
should in publick be found without one buckled about
his Leg, upon Challenge he should be mulct a Noble to
the Dean and College of <i>Windsor</i>. By King <i>Henry</i> VIII.
the Fine was raised a Mark, payable as before to any of
the five Officers of the Order, or to the Dean; besides
which Fine, the Knight lies liable to a Check. But to
alleviate the Strictness, and obviating other Inconveniencies,
King <i>Henry</i> V. admitted of a Qualification; and in
case of riding with Boots, ordained, That it might
suffice if the Knight-Companion wore some Ribband
or Silk-Lace to represent the Garter; tho’ in this very
Article there is a Proviso, That no Knight-Companion
should enter into Chapter, without his Garter buckled
about the Leg.</p>

<p class='c000'>In short, King <i>Henry</i> VIII. ordained, That the Gold-Chain
whereat the lesser <i>George</i> (in that Age) hung,
should be worn all other days in the Year, except the
Principal and Solemn Feasts, whereon the great Collar
was ordained to be worn, and except in time of War,
Sickness, or long Voyage, in any of which Cases, a Silk-Lace
or Ribband, with the Image of St. <i>George</i> thereat,
was sufficient; and the blue Ribband having since succeeded
in Place of the <a id='gold' name='gold'></a>Gold Chain, the Injunction of
this Statute extends to it in all particulars.</p>

the Officers appointed for
the service of the Order, to give it a greater
degree and augmentation of Honour, the
Founder constituted a <i>Prelate</i>, <i>Register</i> and <i>Usher</i>, assigning
them several Duties. Some of his Successors
added the <i>Chanchellor</i> and <i>Garter</i>, and all of them Sworn
to be of the Council of the Order; among these the

the other three the inferiour Officers of the

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> this Chapter we shall give some account of their

Statutes, and more particularly their Duties, will occur
in several places of the ensuing Discourse, where they
properly fall in to be Treated of, as follows;</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Prelate is the first and primier Officer, and in
the Founders Statutes, call’d <i>Prælatus Ordinis</i>; and that
the then Bishop of <i>Winchester</i>, <i>William de Edyngton</i> was
the first Prelate is very <a id='obvious' name='obvious'></a>obvious from thence; he is an
Officer of Honour only, and hath neither Pension nor
Fees allowed him by the said Constitutions; this Office
is vested in the Bishop of <i>Winchester</i>, for the time being;
and from the Annals of the Order it’s manifest his Successors
have continued Prelates to this Day, except the
interruption only of a few Months, <i>Anno</i> 7. <i>Ed.</i> 6. immediately
after the publishing this King’s Statutes;
wherein the other Four Officers were constituted anew,
to attend the Order, but the Prelate wholly laid by.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>What</span> high reputation this See hath been favour’d
with, may be collected from an Act of Parliament, 31.
<i>Hen.</i> VIII. concerning the Placing of the Lords in Parliament
Chamber, and other Assemblies and Conferences
of Council, whereby this Bishop had Place assigned
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>him next to the Bishop of <i>Durham</i>, who hath place by
that Act, next the Archbishop of <i>York</i>; tho’ before in respect
of the prehemenence of this noble Order, he had
precedence and Place granted above all Bishops, and next
unto the Arch-Bishops. At that Officers admittance he is
oblig’d to take an Oath in the presence of the Soveraign
or his Lieutenant, which consists of these particulars.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. <i>To be present in all Chapters, whereunto he is Summoned.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>2. <i>To report all things truly without Favour or Fear.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>5. <i>To promote and maintain the Honour of it.</i></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>This</span> Oath is read in Chapter, by the Register of the

<h3 class='c010'>Of the ROBE.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>As</span> the Knights-Companions had their Surcoats bestowed
on them, at the Sovereigns charge, and therefore
called the Kings Livery, so had the Officers of
the Order their Liveries or Robes out of the Sovereign’s
Wardrobe, and in particular the Prelate of the
Order: For in the Rolls of the great Wardrobe, we
find that <i>William de Edyngton</i> had allow’d him for his
Robe of the Sovereign’s Livery, against the Feast of
St. <i>George</i>, Anno 37. <i>Ed.</i> III. one Cloth of Sanguine
grain, and a large quantity of Furs for trimming it up:
And we find this Robe so assigned the Prelate to be of
the sute or colour of the Knights-Companions Surcoats
the same Year, <i>viz.</i> Sanguine in grain, and that
he had a great allowance of Furr; for his being a Mantle
was larger than any of the Knights Surcoats, tho’ they
are both call’d by the same name <i>Roba</i> in the Rolls
of the Wardrobe, <i>Anno</i> 7. <i>Rich.</i> II. <i>William de Wyckham</i>
<span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>then Prelate had the same allowance, one Cloth of Violet
in grain and other Materials. But the Discrimination
was in the Bellies of Minevers, whose Number
was now much encreased, and that the same allowance
was bestowed on him in the 11th and 19th Years of the
said King. But in these three Instances the Colour of
the Cloth was different, and suitable to the Knights-Companions
Surcoats, those very Years, <i>viz.</i> Violet in
grain, White and Blue, and <i>Anno</i> 12. <i>Hen.</i> VI. the
Robe of <i>Henry Beaufort</i>, Cardinal and Prelate was
White, as then were the Surcoats of the Knights-Companions,
whence it is evident the Livery formerly
allowed the Prelate annually varied in Colour, as did
the Knights-Companions Surcoats.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> that ancient Precedent of the Liveries of the Garter,
remaining in the great Wardrobe, wherein the
Surcoats of the Knights-Companions are reduced to a
Stated proportion in the measure of the Cloth, number
of Furs and Garters, modeled out according to their
state degrees, there the Prelate hath the following allowance
for his Livery,</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>By</span> all which it is manifest what Materials and colour
the Prelate’s Robe was of at the institution of the Order,
and for a long time after, nor do we find any
variation until the Reign of King <i>Hen.</i> VIII. and then
this Habit was ordained to be Crimson Velvet, lin’d
with white Taffaty, faced with blue, and thereon
down the opening before upon the bordures, sundry
Royal cognizances on the right side, the Rose of <i>England</i>
Crowned, on the left side opposite one of King

Beams issuing out of a Cloud, and those Badges repeated
in alternate situations; every Badge interpolated

Forty of these Clouds wrought of Gold, Silver and
Silk, having in the middle the <i>Saxon</i> Letter <i>E</i> of Gold,
were provided to him several Garments made for that

left Shoulder of a Knight Companions Mantle, so the
right Shoulder of the Prelates Robe is injoyned to be
Embroidred with a Scutcheon of St. <i>George</i>’s Arms, encompassed
with a Garter, and adorned with Cordons of
blue Silk mingled with Gold. After a while the colour
of this Robe became changed to Murray. The allowance
of Velvet 16 Yards, of white Sarcenet for Lining 12
Yards, and a Garter for the Shoulder, Embroidred with
Purls of Damask Gold. But 23 <i>Eliz.</i> for the Livery
of Bishop <i>Watson</i> then newly admitted, the quantity
of Velvet was encreased to 18 Yards; but the
Lining and Garter remained as it was, so also the
Cordon, having Buttons and Tassels of blue Silk, and

nothing was effected untill after the Restoration, and

a Garter, wrought with Letters, and Purls of Damask,
Gold and Pearls, having Laces, Buttons and Tassels of
purple Silk, and <i>Venice</i> Gold; but what inducements
the Sovereign had for so changing the Murray Colour
for Purple, has not reached our Intelligence. The
time he is obliged to Wear this Robe, is in express text
<span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span>of the Constitutions, to be Yearly on the Vigil and Day

to surround them, impaling his See. He hath
allotted him convenient Appartments within the Castle

distinct from the Knights-Companions, and subservient
to them, Decreed in a Chapter at <i>Westminister</i>, 16 <i>Regni sui</i>,
That the Seal of the Order should be resigned to
<i>Richard Beauchamp</i>, then Bishop of <i>Salisbury</i> to keep
<span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>during pleasure, and he to be called Chancellor of this
most noble Order; not long after by Letters Patent,
under the Great Seal of <i>England</i>, Dated the 10th of <i>Oct.</i>
15. <i>Edw.</i> IV. this King declared, that tho’ this Office
was not expressed by the Founder’s Statutes, yet was it
nevertheless very useful, and therefore for the Advancement,
and good of the Order, he constituted an Officer
named Chancellor: And forasmuch as this Office
was of great Import and Concern, and required an expert
and able Person, it was His further Pleasure, that
none but a Bishop should Execute it; moreover considering
the Chapel of St. <i>George</i> at <i>Windsor</i>, was Founded
within the Diocess of <i>Salisbury</i>, and having regard to
the prudence and diligence of the said <i>Beauchamp</i>,
who out of meer love to the Order, attended daily the
progress of the Work, wherewith the King was then in
hand for enlarging the Chapel at <i>Windsor</i>; he did
therefore Ordain the said Bishop for the Term of his
Life, Chancellor of the Order, and after his decease,
his Successors, Bishops of <i>Salisbury</i>, should always have
and hold the said Chancellor-ship; Nevertheless, provided
that the King’s Concession should be put in execution,
by the Advice of the Knights-Companions,
and without prejudice to the Bishop of <i>Winchester</i>, in
those things which ought by the Statutes of Institution
to belong unto him.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>This</span> Office thus conferred upon <i>Beauchamp</i> personally
for Life, and perpetually to his Successors, Bishops
of <i>Salisbury</i>, by vertue of this Grant continued
Chancellors, nor doth it appear that any other Person
had been invested therein, until <i>Ann.</i> 7. <i>E.</i> VI. that Sir
<i>William Cecil</i>, then principal Secretary of State, was
made Chancellor.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>For</span> upon Reformation of the Order by that King, his
Statutes wholly excluded the Ecclesiasticks, and appointed
that the Chancellors-Office should be executed
by a Knight qualified, with Honour and Reputation
to manage a Post of that Care and Fidelity; he thereupon
appointed Sir <i>William Cecil</i>, Chancellor; And
here first entred a secular Person, notwithstanding
which in a Charter to the Bishop of <i>Salisbury</i>, 4 <i>Eliz.</i>
(containing the Charters of Queen <i>Mary</i>, <i>H.</i> VIII. and
<span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span><i>H.</i> VII. and in another 4. <i>Car.</i> I.) the forementioned
Letters Patents, made to <i>Beauchamp</i>, by King <i>Edw.</i> IV.
are therein recited <i>totidem verbis</i>, and confirmed as
a Tacit Reservation of the Right and Title of those
Bishops, whensoever the Sovereign should have a
benign and propitious Aspect towards that See. The
first of these Bishops who concerned himself for recovering
this high Station to that See, was Bishop <i>Cotton</i>,
who upon the Death of Sir <i>Edward Dyer</i>, sometime
Chancellor, Petitioned the Sovereign, 6. <i>Jac.</i> I. and prayed
Restitution thereof to the Church of <i>Salisbury</i>; but before
any determination, the two chief Justices, and chief
Baron was advised withal, who were of Opinion, that
this Office was not compleatly or sufficiently annexed
to the Bishoprick of <i>Salisbury</i> by King <i>Edw.</i> IV. But
<i>Cook</i> in his Institutes, reports the point Void, upon the
incertainty of the Grant, for that a new Office was
Erected, and not defined what Jurisdiction or Authority
the Officer should Exercise; and there’s assigned a third
Reason, That the Grant was in the Sovereign’s disposal,
because the Patent was obtained without Fee; with
one or more of these Opinions, the Sovereign’s judgment
being swayed, He forthwith nominated Sir <i>John
Herbert</i>, one of His privy Council to the Chancellor-ship,
and so this affair remained Silent, until <i>Anno</i> 12.
<i>Car.</i> I. when <i>John Davenant</i>, Bishop of <i>Salisbury</i>, upon
Sir <i>Francis Cranes</i> decease, remonstrated to the Sovereign
his Claim to this Office, whereupon at a Chapter
held at <i>Windsor</i>, 5th of <i>Dec.</i> that Year, the Sovereign
propos’d to the Knights-Companions present, that tho’
he had made Election of Sir <i>Thomas Rowe</i> for his
Chancellor that time, yet understanding a Claim made
by the Bishop of <i>Salisbury</i>, that the Place was annexed
to that See, he commanded the Lords-Companions to
take the pretence of right into their considerations; to
which proposition of the King’s, they answered that
they thought it not their duty to search for the Title of
any Person, but that if the Bishop did produce his
Evidence and Proofs, he might present it in Chapter to
be considered.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Upon</span> this Encouragement, the Bishop presented a
Petition, which was read in the Chapter at <i>Windsor</i>,
<span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span>the 18th of <i>April</i> ensuing, to this effect, That King <i>Edw.</i>
IV., by Letters Patent, had Erected this Office of Chancellor,
and did then grant the same to <i>Richard Beauchamp</i>,
Bishop of <i>Salisbury</i>, and his Successors for ever, in consideration
that the Chapel of St. <i>George</i> was within
their Diocess; that those Bishops had enjoyed the same,
according to the Charter, which Charter had been confirmed
under the Great Seal of <i>England</i>, by some other
Kings and Queens, and lastly by the King himself. But
that the use and exercise of that Office had for many
Years been discontinued from them, praying therefore
an Hearing, and Examination, that the right of the
said Church might be preserved and restored. To the
substance of which it was objected.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>First</i>, <span class='sc'>That></span> the Great Seals of <i>England</i> did not work
within, or upon the Statutes and Rules of the Order
of the Garter.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Second</i>, <span class='sc'>That</span> no Grant could prescribe the present
Sovereign, it being a Law Fundamental within the Order,
<i>Suprema Lex</i> was <i>Suprema Voluntas</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Third</i>, <span class='sc'>That</span> it did not appear by the Records of the
Order, that the Office of the Chancellor was any otherwise
conferred upon <i>Richard Beauchamp</i>, Bishop of <i>Salisbury</i>,
than <i>quam diu Regiæ celsitudini complaceret</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>To</span> the <i>First</i>, It was answered by way of Exception,
as to the Grant of Offices, forasmuch as the Great Seal
of <i>England</i> was took into, and became legal within the
Order in like cases; and not any Patent for an Office,
had past under the Seal of the Order, but under the
Great Seal of <i>England</i>, and in particular the Office of
the Chancellor-ship, which had not been transacted, if
any legal defect had been therein.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>To</span> the <i>Second</i>, granting it was so as was Objected, it
appeared that the Sovereign was as much at liberty to
restore this Office to the See of <i>Salisbury</i>, as continue it
to secular Dignities.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>To</span> the <i>Third</i>, what was alledged out of the Records
of the Order, related only to the time of delivering
the Seals to Bishop <i>Beauchamp</i>: But afterwards when
the Office was Erected by Letters Patent, it was then
granted to him during Life. Something was replied
from the Judges Opinions, even in this case, <i>Ann. Jac.</i>
<span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>R. VI. But the Sovereign thought it was not then well
canvass’d and weighed, to permit the Chapter Acts of
this Order, wholly independant from other Laws, to
receive construction and determination from the common
Law, and therefore declared that the Bishop ought
to be heard; and to that purpose, gave him Orders to
prepare the Vouchers and Proofs of his pretensions
in vindication of his Petition, and to send them to be
delivered to the Knights-Commissioners, elected for the
affairs of the Order, for their consideration at the
next Chapter, which was accordingly put in execution,
and then refierred to them again to be considered, prepared
and abbreviated, to be perused by the Sovereign, for
his final determination. But the <i>Scotch</i> War shortly after
breaking forth, and troubles running high at Home,
the further Prosecution was laid aside, and not revived
until the 19th of <i>Nov.</i> <i>Anno</i> 21. <i>Car.</i> II. When <i>Seth
Ward</i>, Bishop of <i>Salisbury</i>, took encouragement upon
the former grounds, and the Sovereign’s favour, to set
on foot this Claim, by a Petition presented to the Chapter
then held at <i>Whitehall</i>, where, after a full debate and
mature deliberation had of its equity and just Foundation,
he obtained a Decree for Re-establishment of
this Office on the Bishops of that See, upon the first
vacancy, Dated the 19th of <i>Nov.</i> 1669. and present
his Majesty the Sovereign, the Dukes of <i>York</i>, and <i>Ormond</i>,
Earls of <i>Oxford</i> and <i>Manchester</i>, Prince <i>Rupert</i>,
Earls of <i>Bristol</i> and <i>Sandwich</i>, and the Duke of <i>Monmouth</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Of the OATH.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>The</span> Oath the <i>Chancellor</i> takes at his Admission
which we find to be the same with the Prelates, and
in the like humble Posture upon the Knee, and usually
Administred by the Register of the Order. As to his
Robe, it was at first the same with the Prelates, both
for Cloth and Colour, but his proportion of Cloth far
less, having allowed him but 5 Yards, when the Prelate
had 24, nor but 3 Timber of Minever gross,
where the Prelate had 19, beside a large quantity of other
Furs; nor was the Colour confined to one kind,
until the constitutions of this Office appointed it to be
<span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span>Crimson, as was the Prelates, for no doubt it was before
annually changed, as his was to the Colour of the
Knights-Companions Surcoats; however by the Picture
of the ancient Habits of the Officers, it is conspicuous,
it was debared the Royal Badges, wherewith the Prelates
Rose was Embroidred; when the Colour of the
Prelates Robe was changed to Murray, the Chancellors
had the same Alteration and was Trim’d alike in all
other particulars. The proportion allowed to Sir
<i>Thomas Smith</i> for his Livery, <i>Anno</i> 14. <i>Eliz.</i> was 18
Yards of Murray Velvet, 12 Yards of Sarcenet for the
Lining, one Garter wrought with Pearls of Damask Gold
for the Shoulder, one Lace (or Cordon) with Buttons,
and Tassels of blue Silk and <i>Venice</i> Gold, and the
same Materials and Quantities were afterwards distributed
out of the Sovereigns great Wardrobe, to the
succeeding Chancellors.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>But</span> <i>Anno</i> 13. <i>Car.</i> I. The Prelate and Chancellor endeavouring
a Reformation in this Habit, the Dye both
of the Prelates and this Officers Robe was changed into
Purple.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Besides</span> this Robe, the Chancellor of the Order hath
an honourable Badge of Distinction assigned him to wear,
first granted to Sir <i>William Peters</i> and his Successors, the
9th of <i>October</i>, 1 and 2 <i>Ph.</i> and <i>Mar.</i> <i>viz.</i> a golden Rose
enclosed within a Garter, which he and his Successors,
Chancellors of the Order, have ever since worn daily
about their Necks; at first it was Pendant in a Gold-Chain,
but since in a Purple Ribband. It seems something
of this Design had been in Agitation a little before,
so soon as the Chancellorship became vested in a
Layman; for King <i>Edward</i> VI’s Statutes did Ordain,
<i>That the Chancellor should wear about his Neck a Cross of the
Order, with a red Rose, in a white, of Gold, all compassed
within a Garland of red and white Roses</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>And</span> because it was suggested to King <i>Charles</i> I. That
there were different Accounts and Uncertainties contained
in some Books concerning the Wearing of this
Badge, He, by Warrant dated at <i>Oxford</i> the 16th of <i>December</i>
in the 21st Year of his Reign, 1645. ordained
Sir <i>James Palmer</i> Kt. and Bart. Chancellor of the said
Order, (and his Successors) <i>should wear about his Neck at
<span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>all times in Honour of his said Place, (that thereby he may be
known to be of that Office and Dignity, as hath been accustomed)
a Medal or Jewel of Gold enamelled with a red Rose,
(within a Garter of Blue enamel, with this Sentence inscribed</i>,
Hony soit qui mal y pense) <i>or such an one as we or the rest
of the Knights-Companions of the said Most Noble Order of the
Garter do or shall from time to time hereafter wear in our Collars
of the said Order in particular Reference to us or them.
And in the Reverse thereof, he shall bear the Escutcheon of
St.</i> George <i>enamelled within a Garter also in reference to the
Order it self, which he only shall wear hanging by a light purple
Ribband, or in a gold Chain, as hath been accustomed</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Among</span> the Officers of the Order, the Chancellor is
seated next beneath the Prelate, and in all Proceedings
and Sessions, goeth, and sitteth, on his left Hand:
And as it was ordered by the Constitutions of the Officers,
That if the Chancellor hapned to be a Layman,
he should be also a Knight, and have other personal
Endowments. So did King <i>Charles</i> I. conceive it requisite
to confer some further Mark of Distinction upon this
Officer, in relation to Place and Precedence without
the Order; to which effect, there passed a Decree in a
Chapter assembled by the Sovereign at <i>Whitehall</i>, the
23d of <i>April</i>, 1623. present, the Earls of <i>Mulgrave</i>, <i>Montgomery</i>,
<i>Rutland</i>, <i>Carlisle</i>, <i>Holland</i>, <i>Suffolk</i>, <i>Pembroke</i>, <i>Arundel</i>
and <i>Surrey</i>, <i>Salisbury</i>, <i>Dorset</i>, <i>Bark-shire</i> and <i>Northampton</i>,
<i>That Sir</i> Francis Crane, <i>the present Chancellor, and all others
that should succeed him in that Place hereafter, shall, in right
of that Place, in all Assemblies, and upon all Occasions, be
ranked and placed immediately after Knights-Privy-Councellors,
and before the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Persons holding
both Places, being in</i> Pari gradu, <i>and consequently before all
others, whom the said Chancellor is to precede</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>And</span> to the intent the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s
Place may be certainly known, <i>May</i> the 20th, 21 <i>Jac.</i> I.
it was thus established, <i>That the Knights of the Most Noble
Order of the Garter, the Privy-Councellors, the Master of the
Courts of</i> Wards <i>and</i> Liveries, <i>the Chancellor and Under
Treasurer of the</i> Exchequer, <i>Chancellor of the</i> Dutchy, <i>the
Chief Justice of the Court of</i> King’s Bench, <i>the Master of the</i>
Rolls, <i>the Chief Justice of the Court of</i> Common-Pleas, <i>the
Chief Baron of the</i> Exchequer, <i>and all other Judges and Barons
<span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span>of the Degree of the Coif, should have Place and Precedency
in all Places, and upon all Occasions before the younger Sons of
Viscounts and Barons, and before all Baronets</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> aforesaid Constitutions provide the Chancellor
of the Order an Habitation within the Castle of <i>Windsor</i>,
as well as the Prelate, which is the South-West Tower
in the lower Ward of the Castle, call’d the <i>Chancellor’s
Tower</i>. The Possession thereof had been for some time
in the Power of others; and therefore by a Chapter
convened at <i>White-hall</i>, <i>Nov.</i> 5th, 5 <i>Car.</i> I. it was restored
unto Sir <i>Francis Crane</i>, then Chancellor of the Order,
and after his Decease, to descend to his Successors.
These Constitutions also ordained him the like Liveries
at the Table and Court of the Sovereign, as were
allowed to the Prelate.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>At</span> the first Erection of this Office, the Chancellor
had no Pension awarded him, until the Constitutions in
reference to the Officers were Established. At that
time there was conferr’d on him a Pension of 100<i>l.</i> <i>per
Annum</i>, in consideration of his Employment, or else an
allowance proportionate in Fees, Offices or other Promotions,
over and above his Lodgings in the Castle,
and Liveries at Court. But as to Fees and Perquisites,
there are none to be Claimed by this Officer; and for
that Reason, he not only possesses the said Pension, but
all his disbursements allowed him, even to Paper,
Wax, and Wafers; and indeed those who enjoyed the
Office esteem’d it as a degradation of their Post, to receive
either fee, or gratuity for any affair Transacted
within the Order; and Sir <i>Thomas Rowe</i>, sometime
Chancellor, affirmed <i>That his Office was an Office of Honour,
and not of Fees, and that he had always excepted against
Fees, for the disbursement of the Sovereign’s Money</i>: Tho’ he
acknowledged some had bestowed on his Clerk a small
gratuity, for the bare Ingrossing of an Alms Knights Patent,
but nothing farther.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>And</span> because the Custody of the Seals of the Order,
appertains to this Officer; it will be here the fittest
Place to mention something of them. By the Statutes of
<i>Edw.</i> III. they were to have a Common Seal. This is
confirmed by the Statutes of King <i>Hen.</i> V. and since
named the Great Seal of the Order. The use of this is
<span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>not only to Seal the Original Statutes, appointed to remain
perpetually within the Treasury of <i>Windsor</i> College,
as also those Copies of which each Knight-Companion is
obliged to conserve one, but likewise all Letters of
Licence to any of the Knights-Companions desirous of
winning Honour abroad, and all Mandates and Certificates,
relating to the Order.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>After</span> what Model the first Seal was compos’d,
we have no exact Relation. <i>Polydore Virgil</i> tells us, That
when the Founder of the Order had fixed Choice of
St. <i>George</i> for its Patron, he represented him Armed,
and Mounted on an Horse, bearing a Silver Shield, and
thereon a Red Cross, but whether St. <i>George</i> thus designed,
was on the first Seal, or only a Scutcheon of his
Arms, as in latter times, is uncertain. But his Author
observes that the Founder Habited his Soldiers in white
Jackets or Coats, and on their Breasts and Backs sowed
Red Crosses, parallel to the Arms assigned to St. <i>George</i>,
as well as to the Kingdom of <i>England</i>, put under his
Patronage, which Arms the Sovereigns of the Order,
have ever since <a id='exhibited' name='exhibited'></a>exhibited in their Standards. But besides
this Common Seal King <i>Hen.</i> V. in the 9th Year of
his Reign, Instituted a privy Signet, in case the Sovereign
should be called out of this Kingdom upon
weighty Affairs. The intent thereof was to affix it to all
Acts passed by the Sovereign beyond Sea, to distinguish
them from those of his Deputies in <i>England</i>. King
<i>Hen.</i> VIII’s Statutes, Ordain the making both of a Common
Seal and Signet, and direct that the Arms of the
Order should be Engraven upon each of them. The
Common Seal used in his Reign was a Garter, within it
a Shield having the Cross of St. <i>George</i>, impaling the
National Arms, the said Shield encompassed with two
Branches hanging from the Regal Crown, which
debruses part of the Garter; the Signet being designed
after the same manner, but less: <i>Temp. Jac.</i> I. it suffered
no other alteration, but only in the National
Arms, by admitting the Quarterings of <i>Scotland</i> and
<i>Ireland</i>, and new-fashioning the Crown, omitting the suspension
of the Shield.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>There</span> was a Seal made at the beginning of the
Reign of King <i>Cha.</i> I. which being esteemed too little
for the Grandure and Honour of the Sovereigns Commissions,
<span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>if was afterwards Decreed in Chapter, held
18th of <i>April.</i> 13. Car. I. <i>That a new one should be made of
a larger Size, with the accustomed Arms and Motto, and the
care thereof commited to Sir</i> Thomas Rowe, <i>Chancellor</i>;
which Command he Executed with all due care and regard,
as is manifestly evident by the nobleness of the
design: One Representation being St. <i>George</i>, in Armour,
adorned with a waveing Mantle, his Bever
open, his Helmet plumed, holding a Shield of his
Arms in his left Hand, and striking with a Sword in his
right, his Body mounted on a bold Horse, Trampling
over a Dragon, which Assails the Champion, the whole
Figure is well contracted, and the Sun, a Rock, the
Bones of devoured Men, and a Mountain in <i>Lointon</i>,
in it is Circumscribed, <i>Magnum sigillum Nobilis Ordinis
Garterij</i>; having the enrichments of festons between
every Word placed pentagonally: The other
Representation, is the Royal Garter imperially Crowned,
enclosing a Shield of the Arms of St. <i>George</i>, impaling
the Sovereign’s Arms, the same Bordered with
Fret-work, and other Ornaments in Cartouche. In
the same decree, direction was given also for a new
Signet, the former being thought too big for Letters,
and this was an Oval shaped so from its Impression,
which was the Garter Crowned, wherein was St. <i>George</i>,
and the Sovereigns Arms impaled.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>It</span> was at the same Chapter further decreed; “That
all Legations to deliver this Order to Foreign
Princes, all other Acts, bearing the Stile of Commissions,
all Patents of Offices and Fees, all Grants
or Licences sent out of the Kingdom, should be Sealed
with this Seal, which should be henceforward called
the Great Seal of the Order; so also the Book of
Statutes, sent to Elect Knights or Foreign Princes,
being fixed to a Label of Blue Silk, and held according
to antient Custom; and that all Letters concerning
the Order, whether of signification of Election,
or Lieutenancy, or Summons upon prorogation,
or other Directions from the Sovereign, should only
be Sealed with the Signet: Moreover, these Seals
were appointed to be thenceforth Born before the
Sovereign in all Publick Assemblies, during the
<span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span>Celebration of St. <i>George</i>’s Feast, or in other its Solemnities
by the Chancellor of the Order, in a Purse
of blue Velvet,” and Command given to Sir <i>Thomas
Rowe</i>, to provid one accordingly; on the foreside of
which Purse was richly Embroidred (by a Gold-Smith)
with <i>Venice</i> Gold and Silver, Gold and Silver Purls and
Plates, and variety of <i>Naples</i> Silks, the Arms of St. <i>George</i>
impaling the Sovereign, surrounded with a Garter
Crowned, having a very fair Running Work, or Compartment
round about it, the charge of which amounted
to 13 <i>l.</i> 16 <i>s.</i> 10 <i>d.</i></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>By</span> the Statutes of Institution, it was ordained, That
in case the Knights-Companions, to whose care the
Sovereign did commit the Seal of the Order, should
upon lawful Occasions, be absent from Court, it behoves
him to leave it behind him, with some other
Knight-Companion to present, to the Sovereign, to
the intent it might be always in readiness; but if
the Sovereign be out of His Kingdom, then the disposal
of it, was commited to the Deputies, and the Signet
of the Order should have a Warrant for all such Acts and
Decrees as should be confirmed there.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> distance from Court was by the Constitutions,
restricted to 10 Miles, and by the Statutes of King
<i>Hen.</i> VIII. to 20. upon consideration whereof we find
Sir <i>Thomas Rowe</i> Chancellor, having some occasions, <i>Anno</i>
13 <i>Car.</i> I. to be absent above 20 Miles, tendred the Seals to
the Sovereign, who was pleased to dispence with the
Statutes, and permitted him to keep them nevertheless.</p>

<p class='c000'>§ 3. <span class='sc'>The</span> Registers Oath, Mantle, Badge, Privileges
and Pension, fall next under our consideration;
he was one of the three, Constituted at the Institution
of the Order, under the Title of <i>Registrator</i> and <i>Registrarius</i>,
and so is called in the Statutes of King <i>Hen.</i> V.
elsewhere in the Books of the Order, <i>Scriba</i> and <i>Actuarius</i>.
What were the first Registers, names we cannot
discover, till the Reign of King <i>Hen.</i> V. But it
may be presumed, they were Canons of <i>Windsor</i>;
because this Office was at first assigned to one of that
College; besides the Registers from the Reign of
King <i>Henry</i> V. to the beginning of King <i>Henry</i> VIIIth
Reign, were also Canons of this College, among
<span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>whom was <i>John Coningham</i>, (and the first found called
so) as the Fragments of a Glass Inscription in <i>Clare</i>
Church near <i>Windsor</i>, where he was Rector, attests. The
first Dean of <i>Windsor</i>, Constituted Register of the Order
was <i>John Vesey</i>, Anno 8. <i>Hen.</i> VIII. many of whose
Successors in this Deanry, have since been admitted;
nevertheless, as they were Canons not Deans of <i>Windsor</i>,
and tis not improbable the Deans were Elected to
this Office, as being enabled to support the Reputation
of the Registership, with the Revenue of his Deanry,
better than any of the Canons, with the addition of the
Pension. But at a Chapter held at <i>Whitehall</i>, the 22d
of <i>April</i>, 11 <i>Car.</i> I. The Sovereign thought it convenient
that the Office of Dean and Register should concenter
in one and the same Person, as formerly, and therefore
commanded this his Pleasuer to be Enrolled among
the Annals of the Order, that so it might pass in the
future Times, from Example into Rule.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>By</span> the Constitutions of the Office, a secular Person
is made capable of it, no less than an Ecclesiastick,
how be it, <i>He is to be a Man of singular integrity</i>, eminent
quality, a Knight, and signalized for Experience and
Learning; but if an Ecclesiastick, then must he be a Person
of consummate Erudition, <i>a professor of Divinity or
Law, either Canon, or Civil</i>, and a Dignitarian in some
Cathedral Church, or else a Canon at <i>Windsor</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> substance of his Oath in the Statute of the
Institutions was, <i>That he should enter upon the Registry, with
all Fidelity, the Scrutinies, Elections, Penalties, Reconciliations,
and all other Acts relating to the Order</i>, to which was added,
that he shall faithfully Discharge his Duty in all
things. But in King <i>Hen.</i> VIIIth Days, the Oath enjoyned
him, differs nothing from that of the Prelates
and Chancellors.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>At</span> his Admission, he takes this Oath Kneeling,
while the Prelate used to pronounce the Words as <i>Anno</i>
1 <i>Mar.</i> 5. and 6. <i>Ph.</i> and <i>Mar.</i> but in his absence, as <i>Anno</i>
3 <i>Eliz.</i> the Chancellor administred it. <i>Anno</i> 4. <i>Car</i>. I.
the Prelate, Chancellor, and Register, took their Oaths
at one time, and then it was thus Ordered; first the
Register took it Kneeling between the Sovereign’s Knees,
the Black Rod holding the Evangelists, and the <i>Garter</i>
<span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span>read the Words out of the black Book; this done,
the Register read the Words of the Prelates Oath,
when he was Sworn; and in the last place, did the
like to the Chancellor; after this manner did Garter
read the Words to the Registers, admitted 11 <i>Car.</i> I. and
12 <i>Car.</i> II. We cannot trace the Habit this Officer had
assigned him at the Erection of the Order; but it afterwards
appears, that his Allowance was the same
with the Chancellors, consisting of 5 Yards of Woollen
Cloth, and 3 Timber of Minever gross, equalent to
what those Knights-Companions had allotted, who
were under the degree of an Earl: The Habit he is
pourtrayed in, at a proceeding of King <i>Hen.</i> VIIIth
Reign, shews it to be Ecclesiastical, a black Gown, a
Surplice over that, reaching to his Ancles, and thereon
a Mantle of Furs; but the Constitutions of his Office
restricted him to none, wherein there seems a defect,
since they have assignd Habits to the Garter, and black
Rod. Notwithstanding by a Draught of the Officers in
their ancient Dress, it is plainly demonstrable to be a
Mantle, somewhat of a Russel colour, Faced with a
Pane of blue, whereon is Embroidred a Flower-de-luce
Crowned Gold, then another Pane red, thereon a
Lyon Passant gardant Crowned Gold, and so they are alternately
placed to the bottom; to this Mantle belong
Cordons of Silk, blue and yellow.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Since</span> that time, not only the Registers, but also Garters
and Black Rods, Robes, underwent some Alterations;
for by a Decree in Chapter, called at St. <i>James</i>,
<i>Jun.</i> 1. 4 and 5. <i>Ph.</i> and <i>Mar.</i> these Officers were assigned
Mantles of crimson Satin, Lined with Taffaty, and
a Scutcheon of St. <i>George</i>’s Arms, Embroidred on the
left Shoulder, but not encircled with a Garter, having
the same Buttons and Tassels as were appointed to the Prelate
and Chancellor; the proportion of Satin assigned
to each Mantle, was 14 Yards, and as many Yards of
white Taffaty.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>And</span> tho’ the Registers Mantle was <i>Ann.</i> 27 <i>Eliz.</i> composed
of the preceeding Materials, and had like Trimming,
yet they agree not in their Proportions, here being
allowed 18 Yards of crimson Satin, and but 12 of
Taffaty; from hence these Mantles continued immutable
<span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span>until the 20th of <i>Feb.</i> 13 <i>Car.</i> II. when there Issued
a Warrant to the Master of the great Wardrobe, to
prepare for this Officer, as also for Garter, and the Black
Rod, for their Liveries Mantles of scarlet Satin, each
containing 18, and 10 Yards of white Taffaty for Lining,
but consonant in all other Punctilio’s with the
former; yet why the colour was altered, is not expressed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Register seems to have been represented with a
Scrowle in his Hand, for his Badge, and by the proceedings
in Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>’s Reign, Pictured with a
Book, both proper Symbols of his Office. In Dr. <i>Christopher
Wren</i>’s Registership, the Sovereign Commanded
him to cover the red Book of the Order with crimson
Velvet, and assigned for the Garter, two Pens in
Saltire, interlacing the Garter above with these two
Letters <i>C R</i> Crowned, all being richly Embroidred,
(as also the Border) with <i>Venice</i> Gold and Silver, and
various colours of <i>Naples</i> Silk, by <i>Harrison</i> the Sovereign’s
Embroiderer, with a Clasp, in Imitation of the
Garter, surrounding the Representation of St. <i>George</i>,
which cost 12 <i>l.</i> 17 <i>s.</i> 6 <i>d.</i> This Book he was Ordered
to bear before his Breast, on all Solemn Occasions
when he wore his Mantle, and for his better Convenience,
he made a Belt and an Ouch to hang it by.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>So</span> high a Regard had the Sovereigns of this Order,
not only to this Officer, but likewise to Garter and
Black Rod, that they took them into a particular Protection,
and by the Constitutions of their Offices
granted them, “That they, their Goods and Servants
should severally remain under the Safe-guard of the
Sovereign; and if any Injury or Violence should
chance to be offered them either by Subjects or Forreigners,
whensoever they should exhibit their Complaint
to the Sovereign, either himself or the
Knights-Companions should afford them Justice; but
if the adverse Party should refuse to submit his Cause
to the Sovereign, then the Sovereign and Knights-Companions
should shew themselves so far inclinable
towards these Officers, as to be ready to allow them
all favour, countenance, <i>&amp;c.</i>” consistent with Justice
and Equity.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span><span class='sc'>Upon</span> the strength and Security of this ancient Privilege,
to avoid the prolongation of a Law Suit,
Dr. <i>Christopher Wren</i> Register, Petitioned the Sovereign
in Chapter, held at <i>Whitehall</i>, the 19th of <i>April</i>, 13
<i>Car</i>. I. against one <i>Thornhill</i>, who under Pretence of
Digging for Salt-Peter, had so Undermined his Pigeon-house,
Built on the Rectory of <i>Knoil Magna</i> in <i>Wiltsh.</i>
that it fell down; and upon reading of the Petition, it
was resolved by the Sovereign, and Knights-Companions,
“That they would consider the Grant in the Constitutions,
and, until it was farther declared, the Chancellor
of the Order should have Power upon Information
of any rigour upon Controverse begun in
any other Court, to write Letters under the Signet
of the Order, that all vexation against them should
be superseded until Information of the cause were given
to and determination in the Cause resumed by the
Sovereign, or leave of him obtained to Proceed.” After
this it is set down, that <i>Thornhill</i> was Summoned
before the Lords Commissioners of the Navy, and his negative
Answer given in, and represented to the Sovereign
in another Chapter, conven’d the 4th of <i>October</i> ensuing;
whereupon it was ordered, “That the Chancellor
should write to the same Lords Commissioners, and
another to the Earls of <i>Pembroke</i>, <i>Arundel</i> and <i>Dorset</i>,
three of the Knights-Companions, to Empower
them, that they or any three of them, should cause
the said <i>Thornhill</i> to be brought before them, and likewise
write to any of the Inhabitants of <i>Knoil</i>, to view
and testifie the Truth, to hear any further proof on
the behalf of either Party, and to give Sentence according
to Justice, that so a tedious Suit of Law might
be prevented, and the Dignity of this most noble Order
protected.” These Commands of the Chancellor
being Executed, and Certificates returned from the
Country, the Knights Companions, in a Chapter held
the 23th of <i>May</i>, 14 <i>Car.</i> I. were moved to peruse them;
but before they could meet, <i>Thornhill</i> fled, and the Prosecution
of this business ceased. Upon the same footing
was it, that the said Dr. <i>Wren</i> obtained from King
<i>Cha.</i> I. His Gracious Protection for himself, Servants,
and Estate, literally expressed in the late War, <i>as the
<span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span>Violaters of that Order would answer this our contrary at their
Peril, Dated at</i> Oxford, <i>under the Signet of this our Order the</i>
12th <i>Day of</i> Dec. <i>in the</i> 19th <i>Year of our Reign</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>This</span> Officer by the Constitutions hath a Pension of
50 <i>l.</i> <i>per Annum</i>, or proportionable in Fees, Offices, or
other Emoluments; and <i>Ann.</i> 1. and 2 <i>Ph.</i> and <i>Mar.</i>
the same numerical Pension was conferred on <i>Owen
Oglethorp</i>, Dean of <i>Windsor</i>, out of the Exchequer, until
some Ecclesiastical Preferment of like value should
devolve on him. The same was confirmed to Dr. <i>Maxey</i>,
by Decree in Chapter, 16 <i>Jac.</i> I. and afterwards to Dr.
<i>Beaumont</i>, by Letters Patent, under the Great Seal of
<i>England</i>, 20 <i>Jac.</i> I. but there needed no Allotment of
Lodgings at <i>Windsor</i> to this Officer, as there was to the
rest, since both the Canons and Dean were provided of
Houses belonging to their Ecclesiastical Dignities within
the College, at the Erection of the Order.</p>

<p class='c008'>§ 4. <span class='sc'>The</span> <i>fourth Officer of the Order is Garter</i>. He Was ordained
by King <i>Henry</i> V. with the advice and consent of all
the Knights-Companions, who for the Honour of the
Order, was pleased he should be the principal Officer
within the College of Arms, and chief of the Heralds.
The Services enjoyned him, relating to the Order,
were in preceding Times, performed by the <i>Windsor</i>
Herald of Arms, an Officer created with that Title by K.
<i>Edward</i> III. much about the time of his Erecting this
Order, and an Annual Pension of 20 Marks, payable
out of the Exchequer, by Letters Patent for Life, which
was confirmed by King <i>R.</i> II.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Sir</span> <i>William Brugges</i> was the Person first created Garter,
and called in the Institution of his Office, <i>Jartier
Roy d’armys des Anglois</i>, but elsewhere stiled <i>Willielmus
Brugges, alias Dictus, Gartier Rex Armorum</i>. This Sir <i>William</i>
became a great Benefactor to St. <i>George</i>’s Church at
<i>Stamford</i>, and in the Windows of the Chancel caused
to be Represented King <i>Edward</i> III. with his twenty
five Knights-Companions kneeling, Habited in their
Mantles and Surcoats of Arms, but now much shattered
and defaced; <i>John Smert</i> his Successor had this
Office conferred on him by Letters Patents, under this
Title <i>Rex Armorum de Garteria</i>, and <i>John Wrythe</i> was stiled
<span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span><i>Principalis Heraldus, &amp; Officiarius inclyti Ordinis Garterij, Armorumq;
Rex Anglicorum</i>, but Sir <i>Gilbert Dethick</i> leaving
out <i>Heraldus</i> joyned <i>Principalis Rex</i>, which still continues.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> the Constitutions of his Office he is called <i>Garterus,
Rex Armorum Angliæ</i>, whom the Sovereign and Knights-Companions
have decreed to be a Gentleman of Blood
and Arms, of unspotted Reputation, and Born within
the Kingdom of <i>England</i>; besides as King <i>Hen.</i> V. did
before, so doth King <i>Hen.</i> VIII. declare that he shall
be chief of all the Officers of Arms, dependant upon
the Crown of <i>England</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> substance of his Oath administred by the Register
at his admission, whilst he humbly kneeleth at the
Sovereign’s Feet, in the Chapter House; is,</p>

<p class='c000'>1. <i>To yield Obedience to the Sovereign, and Knights-Companions.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>2. <i>To keep Silence, and not disclose the Secrets of the
Order.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>3. <i>To make Signification of the Death of each Knight-Companion.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>4. <i>To execute all things faithfully committed to his Care.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>5. <i>To enquire diligently after all the noble Acts of the
Knights-Companions, and certifie them to the Register.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>6. <i>To be faithful in the exercise of his Office.</i></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>And</span> such an Oath Sir <i>Christopher Barker</i> took at a
Chapter held at <i>Greenwich</i> 28 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. when he was
made Garter.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>As</span> for a particular Habit, we do not find any inserted
in the Great Wardrobe, whence it is presumed, he
was at first distinguished from the rest of the Officers of
the Order, by his Coat Embroidred with the Sovereign’s
Arms, like as the Provincial King’s then wore.
But after the Constitutions of the Officers were Established,
there was assigned him a Habit or Mantle in all
respects, resembling the Register, (saving that the
Ground whereon the Lyons and flower-de-luces were
Embroidred, was entirely Red) and this to be wore
only at the publick Solemnities of the Order. Queen
<i>Mary</i> Commanded it to be made of crimson Satin, and
so it remained till the Restoration, when the Colour
was altered to scarlet.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span><span class='sc'>This</span> Officer is appointed to bear a white Rod or
Scepter at every Feast of St. <i>George</i>, the Sovereign being
present, gilded at both ends, and at the top the Arms
of the Order impaling the Sovereign’s Arms pourtray’d
on an oblong Cube Crowned, but no directions are
given in the Constitutions for this Crown, nor for that
Ducal one on his Head wherewith his Effigies has
been represented, and yet at all great Solemnities is
never used that we can discover. There was assigned
him by Queen <i>Eliz.</i> a Badge of Gold to be worn daily
by him and his Successors, before the Breast, in a gold
Chain or Ribband, and thereon Ennamelled the
Sovereign’s Arms, Crowned with an Imperial Crown,
and both surrounded with the Garter: But Sir <i>Edward
Walker</i> when made Garter, obtained the Sovereign’s
leave to Impale therein St. <i>George</i>’s Arms, with those
of the Sovereign’s, which Badge is alike on both
sides.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>There</span> is an House appointed for his Habitation
within <i>Windsor</i> Castle, called Garters Tower. It was
by Chapter annexed for ever to the Office of Garter,
and restored to Sir <i>William Segar</i>’s Possession, 2d of
<i>May</i>, 1630. By the Constitution of his Office, he is to
be allowed Barons Service in the Sovereign’s Court,
and his Table Served next after the Dean of the Chapel,
with such Liveries as of old were accustomed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>It</span> appears that King <i>Hen.</i> V. after his erecting this
Office, died before he had settled a Pension upon Sir
<i>William Brugges</i>, for supportation of his little Estate,
which the Knights-Companions taking into consideration,
and that he might more honourably comport himself
to the Service of the Order, till the young King
should come to Age, they being assembled in a Chapter,
with the consent of the Prelate, decreed the said
Sir <i>William</i> to receive of each of them at every Feast of

<p class='c000'><i>Anno</i> 3 <i>Hen.</i> IV. this Office is called <i>Officium Virgarij

under the restriction of these Qualifications, that he be

As <i>Garter</i> was Entituled the Principal Officer of Arms,

repugnant to the preceding Decree, and the Great-Seal
surreptitiously gained, but ought likewise to have passed

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Form of the Oath given to this Officer, <i>temp.
Hen.</i> VIII. was, <i>Truly and Faithfully to observe and keep all
the Points of the Statutes of the Order as to him belonged and
appertained</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>He</span> hath the like Habit with the Register and Garter
before described, but his Ensign and Badge is somewhat
different from Garter’s; for first, it was ordained, <i>That
he or his Deputy should carry a Black-Rod</i> (whence he hath
his Title) <i>before the Sovereign, or his Deputy, at the Feast of
St.</i> George, <i>within the Castle of</i> Windsor, <i>and at other Solemnities
and Chapters of the Order</i>. On the Top of which
there ought to be set a Lyon of <i>England</i>. This Rod
serves instead of a Mace, and has the same Authority to
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span>apprehend Delinquents, and such have offended against
the Statutes of this Most Noble Order. And
where he apprehends any one of the Order, as Guilty of
some Crime for which he is to be expell’d the Order,
the manner of it is by touching them with this Black-Rod,
and his Fee for it, is 5 <i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>He</span> has assigned him a Golden Badge to be openly
worn in a Gold Chain, or Ribband, before his Breast,
composed of one of the Knots in the Collar of the Order
which tye the Roses together, and encompassed
with a Garter, being alike on both sides; which was
conferred on him and his Successors, by Decree in
Chapter, held the 24th of <i>April</i>, 8 <i>Eliz.</i></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>’Tis</span> as ancient as <i>Hen.</i> Vth’s Reign, for there’s a
House in <i>Windsor</i> Castle granted to this Officer by Letters-Patent,
during Life. And the same Provision is
made for him by the Constitutions of his Office. It is
situate on the South-side of the Castle in the middle
Ward. The said Constitutions give him Baron-Service
at Court, and Livery thereto appertaining; and besides
these, the keeping of the said Castle, and the two Parks
adjacent.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>King</span> <i>Charles</i> I. having taken into his Hands the
little Park of <i>Windsor</i>, and bestow’d it upon <i>James
Maxwell</i>, then Usher of the Black-Rod, He, at a Chapter
held at <i>Whitehall</i>, the 5th of <i>November</i>, 1629. decreed,
That as the Custody of the said Park was conferr’d
on <i>Maxwell</i> in right of his Office; so the same
should for ever after be annex’d thereto, and not to be
disposed of but under the Great Seal of the Order, and
that only to the Usher of the Order for the time being.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Lastly</span>, this Officer had anciently a Fee of 12 <i>d.</i> <i>per
diem</i>, which we find continu’d down in the Letters-Patents,
whereby this Office was granted. Besides
which, the Constitutions of his Office allow him an
annual Pension of 30 <i>l.</i> heretofore paid him out of the
Exchequer, but by King <i>Charles</i> I. assigned him out of
1200 <i>l.</i> <i>per Ann.</i> settled upon the Order; touching
which, and the Payment of the Officers Pensions upon
the new Establishment, is the next Section.</p>
<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>§. 6. <span class='sc'>King</span> <i>James</i> I. taking into his Royal Breast,
the Constitution of this Most Noble Order, that it was
in the Nature of a Distinct Sovereignty, govern’d by
Laws and Conventions proper to the Body, and himself
as Sovereign in Matters immediately relating
thereunto, had the sole and uncontroulable Authority
of revising, adding, or explaining; and finding that
the Pensions paid to the Officers of the Order (as those
to the Alms-Knights) and some other Expences, had
been anciently made payable out of his Exchequer by
vertue of the Great Seals of <i>England</i>, or otherwise by
Privy-Seals; and conceiving it incongruous, that the
Officers should claim their Pensions by vertue of any
other Seal than that of the Order, for it is in some
kind derogatory to the Honour of the Order, to permit
other Seals to be used within the same: He thereupon
with twelve Knights-Companions in a Chapter
held at <i>Whitehall</i>, the 22d of <i>May</i>, 20 <i>Jac.</i> I. passed a
Decree, <i>That all things concerning the Order should hereafter
be ratify’d under the Seal of the Order only, and in particular,
that the Grants of poor Knights Places, after their
being Signed by the Sovereign, should be passed under the Seal of
the Order only, and none other</i>. And the Year following,
the Chancellor was ordered, <i>That he should take Advice
of the Sovereign’s</i> Attorney-General <i>how by Vertue of the
Seal of the Order, the Pensions</i>, (given to the Poor Knights)
<i>might be paid and receiv’d</i>, His Majesty’s further Pleasure
being, <i>That all Grants and Payments concerning the Order,
should afterwards be confirmed under the Seal of the Order only,
and by Vertue thereof</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>As</span> to the Alms-Knights Patents, this Decree was of
Force and Validity, but in the other Generals, how far
it was pursu’d we know not; for in some of them it grew
obsolete and useless. But in a Chapter called at <i>Windsor</i>,
the 22d of <i>April</i>, 10 <i>Car.</i> I. a Debate arose about setting
a Part of the Annual Summ of 1000 <i>l.</i> out of the Receipts
of his Majesty’s Exchequer, to be employ’d particularly
in discharge of Expences towards the Feasts of
the Order, Legations to Foreign Princes, Payment of
the Officers Pensions, <i>&amp;c.</i> disbursed for the Necessity
and Reputation of this Noble Order. Afterwards at a
<span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span>Chapter held the 18th of <i>April</i>, 13 <i>Car.</i> I. that Sovereign
ratify’d his Royal Assignation, and increased his
Bounty to 1200 <i>l.</i> <i>per Ann.</i> setling it for those designs in
a Perpetuity for ever, and making it payable out of the
Customs in the Port of <i>London</i>, but to be received by
the Chancellor of the Order for the time being, as Treasurer
of this Money, of which he was to give up an Account
to the Sovereign and Knights-Companions yearly
at St. <i>George</i>’s Feast. And in pursuance of this Ratification,
the Attorney-General had Instructions to draw up a Book
for his Royal Signature to Warrant its passing under the
Great Seal of <i>England</i>, which was dispatch’d, the Letters-Patent
bearing <i>teste</i> at <i>Westminster</i>, the 23d of <i>January</i>,
13 <i>Car.</i> I. Immediately after, Sir <i>Thomas Rowe</i>, the
Chancellor of the Order, presented a List of the ordinary
Fees and Charges of the Order, upon which it was agreed
to, <i>That there should issue out a standing Commission
to the Chancellor under the Great Seal of the Order to warrant
the Yearly Payments, and he to be discharged according as the
said Patent had provided</i>. This Commission passing the
Great Seal the 3d of <i>May</i>, 14. <i>Car.</i> I. the Sovereign thereby
impower’d the Chancellor to make payable out of
the yearly Revenue of 1200 <i>l.</i> all and every the yearly
Fees, Pensions, Salaries, and other Payments due and
payable to the Officers of the Order, Alms-Knights, or
others, appertaining to the Order, either by Charter,
Grant, or Assignation under the Seal and Signet of the
Order, or by any other Lawful way whatsoever, and in
particular,</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Manner of the Chancellor’s passing his Account,
as directed by the said Commission, was thus done by
Sir <i>James Palmer</i>, He humbly moved the Sovereign in
Chapter held the 10th of <i>October</i>, 15 <i>Car.</i> I. That it
would please him to view the Disbursements made for
the Expences of the Order, which thereupon being Examined
by the Knights in the Sovereign’s Presence, the
same were found agreeable to the Directions of the Commission,
and the Payments justify’d by the Acquittance of
every Officer to whom any Fee was due, no Payment having
been made without the Sovereign’s Hand first to Authorize
it: All which being seen and allow’d, the Account
(wherein his Disbursements exceeded his Receipts <a id='ds' name='ds'></a>37 <i>l.</i>
13 <i>s.</i> 10 <i>d.</i>) was esteemed Equitable and Just, and passed
by the Subscription of <i>Charles</i> then Prince of <i>Wales</i>, the
Earls of <i>Pembroke</i> and <i>Montgomery</i>, <i>Salisbury</i>, <i>Holland</i>,
<i>Berk-shire</i>, Duke <i>Hamilton</i>, and the Earl of <i>Northumberland</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span>§. 7. <span class='sc'>The</span> Executions of these Offices is the last thing
here to be described: For tho’ all the Officers are
strictly obliged to give personal Attendance to their
Offices; yet, in case of Sickness, Absence out of the
Kingdom, or other emergent Reasons, the Sovereign is
pleased to dispence with them, and constitute others to
Officiate in their stead, who on such Occasions wear the
Robe of that Officer whom they represent, so in case of
Vacancy, the Absence of the Prelate at the Grand Feast
celebrated at <i>Windsor</i>, 31 <i>Hen.</i> VI. is noted in the <i>Black
Book</i> to have been upon just Cause, and the Bishop of
<i>Bangor</i> officiated Divine Service, and next Morning celebrated
the Mass <i>pro defunctis</i>. The following Year,
his Place in these religious Duties was supply’d by the
Bishop of <i>Salisbury</i>, as <i>Ann.</i> 36 and 37 <i>Hen.</i> VI. and at
all times of the Prelates absence, the Sovereign hath
made known his Will what Bishop should supply for
him. The Office of Chancellor hath been executed by
Proxies, and to this may first be referred a Passage in
the <i>Black Book</i>, where Dr. <i>Taylor</i> hath the Title of <i>Vice-Chancellor</i>.
Of later times, when Sir <i>Thomas Rowe</i> was
employ’d in an Embassy into <i>Germany</i>, Sir <i>James Palmer</i>,
Kt. (one of the Gentlemen-Ushers of the Privy-Chamber)
was deputed by the Sovereign to the Chancellor-ship
during his Absence, having the Purse with
the Seals deliver’d to him the 4th of <i>May</i>, 14 <i>Car.</i> I. being
sworn by the Register of the Order <i>durante deputatione
&amp; beneplacito Regis</i>, which Clause was likewise annex’d
in the Deputy <i>Chancellor</i>’s Oath, 12 <i>Car.</i> II. Upon Sir
<i>Thomas Rowe</i>’s return, and indisposition, 16 <i>Car.</i> I. Sir
<i>James</i> was again deputed <i>Chancellor</i>, and a third time,
18 <i>Car.</i> I. continu’d Deputy <i>Chancellor</i> unto the Death of
Sir <i>Thomas Rowe</i>, of which the Sovereign being inform’d
at <i>Oxford</i>, 1644. reserved the disposal of this Office ’till
Sir <i>James</i>’s return to Court, and then commanded him
to wear the Badge and Ribband about his Neck, ’till a
Chapter of the <i>Order</i> compleated his admittance.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> the Vacancy of the Register-ship, <i>Ann.</i> 2 H. VIII.
<i>Thomas Ruthall</i> Bishop of <i>Durham</i>, supply’d it: And
<i>Ann.</i> 18 and 19 <i>Eliz.</i> Dr. <i>Day</i>, Dean of <i>Windsor</i>, executed
the Office, and attended at the Feasts of St. <i>George</i>,
<span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>as Deputy-Register; Dr. <i>George Carew</i> then Register,
having Licence by his Patent to execute it by himself
or Deputy, being dispenc’d with by the Queen in case
of Sickness, or other Impediment. After his Decease,
Dean <i>Day</i> was commanded to execute the Office during
its Vacancy (being 14 Years) which he effected ’till he
was advanced to the Bishoprick of <i>Winchester</i>, <i>An.</i> 38 <i>Eliz.</i>
upon which, Dr. <i>Robert Bennet</i> (who succeeded him in
his Deanry) was the same Year admitted Register.
Afterwards, Dr. <i>Beaumont</i>, being much broken with
Age, and other Diseases, Dr. <i>John King</i>, the junior
Canon, supplied his Place.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Office of Garter hath been supplied by Deputation:
For in those Embassies with the Ensigns of the
Order to Foreign Princes, where special Occasions detained
Garter at home, some of the Kings or Heralds of
Arms, have been order’d upon those Employments,
upon the Recommendation of Garter to the Sovereign;
whereof there are several Instances; the last of <i>Gregory
King</i>, Esq. <i>Lancaster</i>-Herald, who lately carried over
the Habit to the Elector of <i>Hanover</i>. So also in case of
Vacancy; for we find that <i>Clarencieux</i>, King of Arms,
executed this Office after Sir <i>Gilbert Dethick</i>’s Death, in
<i>January</i>, 27 <i>Eliz.</i> being then sent with the Earl of <i>Darby</i>
to the <i>French</i> King <i>Henry</i> III. As also in Reference to
the Preparations the 15th of <i>April</i> following, and Service
performed thereat, and at the Feast of St. <i>George</i>
ensuing.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Constitution of the Office of Black-Rod admit
of a Deputy to bear the Rod before the Sovereign, where
a lawful Occasion impedes his personal Service. And
Sir <i>Peter Young</i>, (Chief Gentleman-Usher,) performed
this Office at the Feast of St. <i>George</i> held at <i>Windsor</i>,
<i>Ann.</i> 6 <i>Car.</i> I. <i>James Maxwell</i>, Esq. Black-Rod, was in
<i>France</i> upon the Sovereign’s Service; and after, being
Mission’d by the King into <i>Scotland</i>, <i>Peter Newton</i>, Esq;
supplied his Place at the Feast at <i>Windsor</i>, 8th, 9th, and
10th of <i>October</i>, <i>Anno</i> 15 <i>Car.</i> I.</p>

  <h2 id='ch09' class='c005'>CHAP. IX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>§. 1.</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_6 c009'><span class='sc'>We</span>
come now to treat of the Election of
a Knight into the Order, according to
the Statutes of Institution, which Ordains,
That whensoever any Knight-Companion happens
to depart this Life, <i>The Sovereign (or his Deputy)
after certain Notice had thereof, should forthwith by his Letters,
Summon all the Knights-Companions then within the
Realm (who were able to come) to meet him within Six Weeks
after such Notice, in what convenient Place soever he pleased to
assign for the Electing a new Companion into the Society</i>. Thus
did the Law of this Most Noble Order, in case of Death,
and to prevent Vacancies, at first provide; wherewith
we evidently find the Practice of elder Times did punctually
concur: For as soon as Garter, in Discharge of
his Duty, had made Certificate to the Sovereign of a
Knight-Companion’s Decease, or otherwise to the Register
of the Order, all fitting Diligence was used to
fill up the vacant Stall, within the Space limited by this
Statute, or immediately after, and for the quicker Dispatch,
Letters of Summons were issued to the Knights-Companions,
to give personal Attendance at the Election.
In an ancient one upon the Death of Sir <i>Henry Fitz Hugh</i>,
Knight-Companion, <i>Temp. Henry</i> V. these particulars
were no less pursuant to the Statutes, than worthy Observation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I. The Day whereon the defunct Knight-Companion
died is therein set down.</p>

<p class='c000'>“II. Direction is given for celebrating Masses, according
to the Tenor of the Statutes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“III. Intimation that a Stall is become void by the
Knight’s Decease.</p>

<p class='c000'>“IV. The Law of the Order vouched, which appoints
an Election of another Knight within six
Weeks after Certificate made of the Death of the
former, to avoid as much as may be an interval in
Succession.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span>“V. The Sovereign’s Power asserted where he sees
Cause to Prorogue the Election.</p>

<p class='c000'>“VI. An Injunction to attend personally at the Election,
under a Penalty express’d in the Statutes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“VII. The Day, Place, and Hour for Appearance is
with certainty appointed, to the End all might Accommodate
themselves to be present.</p>

<p class='c000'>“VIII. The End of coming is mention’d with full
Disposition and Preparation <i>to perform what the Statutes
in this Case requir’d</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>“IX. Lastly, Direction is there given to the Knight
summoned, that in case his coming to the Chapter was
impeded, he should certifie the Reason of his Default
against the time of his Appearance, of the Validity
whereof the Sovereign was to be sole Umpire.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>And</span> generally of these Topicks, and to this Purport
were the Letters of Summons in succeeding times composed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> before-mention’d Branch of the Statutes of Institution
hath been sufficiently enforced by Incorporating
it into the Statutes, <i>temp. H.</i> V. and <i>H.</i> VIII. nor
hath it since undergone any Alteration; howbeit some
further Addition and Explanation were annexed to
them, 21 <i>Jac.</i> I. at a Chapter held at <i>Windsor</i> the 24th
of <i>April</i> that year, where it was decreed, <i>That the Sovereign
being advertised of the Death of a Knight-Companion,
the Knights-Companions remaining at Court should move him
to declare his Pleasure whether he would that Letters should be
sent to all the Knights-Companions within the Realm to attend
his Person for the Choice of a new Knight, at a Day by the said
Sovereign appointed, according to the ancient Statutes of the
Order, or be pleas’d to defer the Election until the Feast of St.</i>
George, <i>at what time Elections have been most usually made;
and according as he resolv’d in what Place it should be, so it
ought</i> (by Letters directed to the Knights-Companions
within the Realm) <i>to be made known unto them</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Deferring, or Prorogation of the Election, was
no new thing, tho’ not indulged by the Statutes, or declared
Law, before this 21 <i>Jac.</i> I. as is evident by the
Letter of Summons sent after the Death of Sir <i>Robert
D’Umfrevil</i>, Knight Companion, <i>temp. H.</i> 4. wherein Notice
<span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>is taken of the Limitation given by the Statutes, after
Certificate of Death, <i>viz.</i> Six Weeks, within the Space
whereof a new Election was to commence; yet where a
Chapter for Election could not conveniently be summoned
within that limited Time, it was sufficient if the
Soveraign declared as he did in the said Placart and
entered in the Black Book, <i>That being then involved in
other Business, he could not well attend this Affair, and therefore
deferr’d the time for Election, unto the Eve of St.</i> George
<i>next following</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>But of later Date, this formal Way of Summons by
Letter, hath been discontinued, and only remained to
such as are remote, and warned only by a verbal Message.
For the Chancellor of the Order having consulted the
Soveraign’s Pleasure, as to the Day and Place, usually
acquaints Garter therewith, who thereupon goes immediately
to the Knights Companions then at Court, and
desires their Attendance at the Chapter, according to the
Soveraign’s Designation.</p>

<p class='c000'>And here it is to be remarked, that no Knight Elect
ought to be summoned to a Chapter of Election, or are
rendered sufficient of giving their Votes therein, until
they be compleatly installed, either in Person, or by
Proxy. Nor indeed did any Necessity intervene, or require
it till the late rebellious times, when the Castle of
<i>Windsor</i> being Garrison’d by the Parliament’s Forces, it
was not possible for the Duke of <i>York</i> and Prince <i>Rupert</i>,
to take Possession of their Stalls, as the Law of the Order
enjoined. Therefore the then Soveraign, whose
Right it is, did, 17 <i>Jan.</i> 1644, dispense with their Installations
in St. <i>George</i>’s Chapel, for the present, and
invested them with the Privileges of the Order, among
which the Power of voting in Chapter, was one: Provided
those Princes should first take the Oath given at
Installations, and afterwards perform the accustomed
Ceremonies, so soon as it should be thought convenient,
and the Castle was restored to the Possession of his Majesty.
In compliance to which Proviso they both then
took the Oath, and on the Eve of the first Feast of
St. <i>George</i> after the Restoration, the Duke was installed;
and on the Eve of the second Feast, 15 <i>Car.</i> 2. by the
<span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span>Earls of <i>Northumberland</i> and <i>Berk-shire</i>; and the Prince by
the Duke of <i>Albemarle</i> and Earl of <i>Lindsey</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>§. 2. <i>The Place of Election.</i>] <span class='sc'>But</span> at what time soever
the Ceremony of Election is purposed, the same ought
to be Celebrated in Chapter, (for so is the Assembly of
the Sovereign and Knights-Companions call’d, where
or whensoever conven’d) whether at the Solemnity of
St. <i>George</i>’s Feast, the ordinary or most accustom’d Time,
or on other Days specially set apart by the Sovereign;
and when the Sovereign thinks fitting in the Interval
of Feasts, to elect any Foreign Prince or other Person,
Stranger or Subject, he often transacts it in peculiar
Chapters called to that purpose, and then appoints both
Day and Place, having that Prerogative. Some few
Examples both of pristine, and of late Time, make it
manifest and apparent.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>But</span> for the most Part since the Beginning of Queen
<i>Elizabeth</i>’s Reign, <i>Whitehall</i>, the Sovereign’s almost constant
Court and Abode, hath been the usual Place
whereunto all the Knights Companions have been specially
Summon’d, and peculiar Chapters assembl’d for
Election in the Intervals between the Vacancy and St.
<i>George</i>’s Feast. However, while King <i>Charles</i> II. was in
Exile, and wanted the compleat Number of Knights to
constitute a full Chapter, he was necessitated not only to
dispence with the Ceremony of Election in Chapter, but
also in supplying the Defect of a Scrutiny, by making
his own Election; yet after his Restoration, <i>Whitehall</i>
recover’d her wonted Honour, and <i>April</i> the 1st. 13
<i>Car.</i> II. at a Chapter call’d and held in the <i>Bed-Chamber</i>
there, the Duke of <i>Richmond</i>, the Earls of <i>Lindsey</i>, <i>Manchester</i>,
and <i>Strafford</i> were elected.</p>

<p class='c008'>§. 3. <span class='sc'>In</span> the next Place we are to consider what Number
of Knights-Companions ought to be assembl’d to
make up a compleat Chapter of Election.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>By</span> the Statutes, there should be Six in Number at
the least, besides the Sovereign or his Deputy; the
due observance of which hath been so strict formerly,
that Elections have been deferr’d where Chapters have
been deficient in that Number; for Proof of which, the
Duke of <i>Gloucester</i>, <i>Ann.</i> 9 <i>Hen.</i> VI. then Deputy to the
Sovereign (at that Time in <i>France</i>) for Celebrating the
Feast of St. <i>George</i> at <i>Windsor</i>, forbore to proceed to Election,
<span class='pageno' title='230' id='Page_230'></span><i>because the Number of Knights-Companions there
assembled was less than the Statutes requir’d</i>. And <i>Ann.</i> 10
<i>Hen.</i> V. no Election was Solemniz’d, tho’ one Stall was
void by the Death of the Lord <i>Clifford</i>, and probably
for that reason; for the Earl of <i>Bedford</i>, then the Sovereign’s
Deputy, had but three Knights present with him,
<i>Ann.</i> 22, or rather 23. <i>Humphry</i> Duke of <i>Bucks</i> being
deputed to celebrate the Feast of St. <i>George</i> at <i>Windsor</i>,
altho’ there was at that Time four Stalls vacant, yet
did no Nomination pass; one reason, <i>because there was
not present a sufficient Number to compleat the Election</i>. So
when the same King celebrated the Grand Feast personally
at <i>Windsor</i>, <i>Anno</i> 31. <i>Regni sui</i>, having but three
Knights attending him thereat, the Election was Prorogu’d
for the very same Reason; in like manner 32, 33
and 34 <i>Hen.</i> VI. the Elections were retarded, for at the
first of them there were present but two Knights-Companions,
besides the Sovereign’s Deputy; and at the
Two last but four, besides the Sovereign, tho’ the <i>Registrum
Cartaceum</i>, <i>Ann.</i> 33. names five by adding the
Duke of <i>Somerset</i>. At the Feast of St. <i>George</i> celebrated
at <i>Windsor</i>, <i>A. D.</i> 1471. <i>Temp. Edw.</i> IV. the Sovereign
fully resolving to Constitute an Election, and having
but five Knights-Companions present, <i>Calys</i>, Pursuivant
at Arms, was dispatch’d to <i>London</i> for Sir <i>John Astley</i> to
repair thither and compleat the Chapter, rather than
violate the Laws of the Order. <i>January</i> the 31st. 21
<i>Car.</i> II. being design’d for the Election of <i>Christopher</i> Duke
of <i>Albemarle</i>, and there being Conven’d but five Knights
at the Chapter, the Election was put off ’till the Third
of <i>February</i> following, at which Time a proportionable
Number of Knights being present, his Election receiv’d
their Approbation.</p>

<p class='c008'>§. 4. <span class='sc'>Yet</span> in cases of Necessity only, and to illustrate
the Power and Prerogative of the Sovereigns, where
the Exigency requires it, tho’ not to be made use of
where there is a possibility to perform the Rules and
Injunctions of the Statutes, the Sovereigns for divers
Reasons, have been induced to dispence with this
Branch of the Statute for want of a plenary Number to
compleat a Chapter. And the first Liberty observ’d
<span class='pageno' title='231' id='Page_231'></span>herein, was made use of by King <i>Henry</i> VIII. <i>Ann.</i> 26.
<i>Regni sui</i>, who upon the Death of the Lord <i>Montjoy</i>, very
speedily assembl’d a Chapter at <i>Whitehall</i>, where no
more than five Knights-Companions being present, the
Absence of the rest were excus’d by special Grace and
Favour, and the <i>Injunction of the Statute</i> (as the <i>Annals</i>
subjoin) <i>concerning the Number of Nominators</i>, were by the
same Clemency dispenc’d with, because of the Exigency
of the Time and Place, and immediately upon taking a
Scrutiny, <i>James</i> V. King of <i>Scotland</i> was elected into
the Fellowship of this illustrious Order, but from
that Time to the Rebellion, there occurs not any thing
of this Nature; but the Wickedness of those Days created
new Exigencies and Projections, which occasion’d, or
rather inforc’d the Sovereign, King <i>Charles</i> I, most unwillingly
to awaken and rouse up this dormant Prerogative,
which he put in Execution at a Chapter purposely
assembl’d for the Election of <i>Thomas</i> Earl of <i>Strafford</i>,
held at the City of <i>York</i> the 12th of <i>September</i>, 16 <i>Car.</i> I.
where at that Time and Place he dispenc’d with the
Defect of Number of Six Knights-Companions, having
then with him Four only, some of the rest being engag’d
in his Service against the <i>Scots</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Afterwards</span> when several of the Knights-Companions
so much adhered to the <i>Long Parliament</i>, that all
Summons were ineffectual to draw them to their Attendance
upon their Sovereign, tho’ but to celebrate the
Grand Festival of their Patron (much less to the compleating
Chapters of Election) to which they were
obliged by the Oath taken at their Installment, the Sovereign
was constrain’d to extend further his Supreme
Authority; and thereupon at the Feast of St. <i>George</i>, celebrated
at <i>York</i>, the 18th, 19th and 20th of <i>April, Ann.</i>
18. <i>Regni sui</i>, in a Chapter held on the Eve of the said
Feast by himself and but four other Knights Companions,
It was Order’d, <i>That Letters of Dispensation should be drawn
up for the insufficient Number</i> (as wanting Six Knights)
<i>to hold a Chapter of Election, and for Authorizing the Knights
then present to deliver in their Votes according to Custom in other
Scrutinies, that so the Sovereign might proceed to the Election
design’d</i>. By vertue of which Dispensation, the Duke
<span class='pageno' title='232' id='Page_232'></span>of <i>York</i> and Prince <i>Rupert</i> were elected Fellows of this
noble Society.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> like Dispensation was made at <i>Oxford</i> upon the
2d of <i>March, Anno</i> 20. <i>Car.</i> I. there being but five
Knights-Companions present with the Sovereign; at
which Chapter, <i>William</i> Prince of <i>Orange</i>, and <i>Bernard de
Foix</i>, Duke of <i>Espernon</i>, were elected.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Last</span> of all, in reference to the holding three several
Chapters preparatory to the Feast of St. <i>George</i>, and
grand Installation celebrated at <i>Windsor</i> the 15th, 16th,
and 17th of <i>April</i>, 13. <i>Car.</i> II (one of which Chapters
was held for the Election of Four Knights, and to deliberate
with the surviving Knights-Companions) the
Sovereign was pleas’d the 29th of <i>March</i> preceeding, to
pass the like Dispensation under the Signet of the Order,
and his own Sign Manual, for this defect; and thereby
made those three Chapters as legal as if the Number of
Knights-Companions had been compleat.</p>

<p class='c008'>§. 5. <span class='sc'>We</span> are now arriv’d at opening the Chapter,
whereinto neither the Sovereign, nor any of the Knights-Companions
are to be admitted without the Ornament,
both their Mantles and Garters, as the Statutes ordain,
and the Law is still in force, tho’ the Chapter hath been
assembl’d elsewhere than at <i>Windsor</i>. As for instance,
one call’d at <i>Whitehall</i> for the Election of <i>John</i> Count
Palatine of the <i>Rhine</i>, <i>Anno</i> 20. <i>Eliz.</i> the Earl of <i>Huntingdon</i>,
and the Lord <i>Grey</i> of <i>Wilton</i>, not having their
Mantles then at Court, were not permitted to enter into
the Chapter to give their Votes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>King</span> <i>Charles</i> I. determining to call a Chapter for
electing the foresaid <i>Thomas</i> Earl of <i>Strafford</i> at <i>York</i>,
where neither he nor any of the Knights-Companions
then attending his Person, had the Robes of the Order
with them; and taking into his Royal Consideration,
the Statutes now mention’d, did by his Authority, as
Sovereign of the Order, dispence with those Knights
then present for coming into the Chapter without their
Mantles.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Afterward</span>, upon other Emergencies that ow’d
their Origin to the late Rebellion, the Sovereign did
the like in some subsequent Chapters held at <i>Oxford</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span><span class='sc'>After</span> the Restoration, a Dispensation passed the
Signet of the Order, dated the 10th of <i>January</i>, 12
<i>Car.</i> II. (the Great Seal being under the Hand of the
Graver but not finish’d) He was necessitated to make
use of his Supreme Authority for holding a Chapter the
14th of <i>January</i> following, in regard the Knights-Companions
then in being were not as yet provided of new
Robes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Presuming</span> then, that a full Number of Knights,
(in Obedience to their Summons) are attending their
Sovereign habited in their Mantles and Garters, and
entred into the Chapter-House at <i>Windsor</i>, or other
Place appointed for this Assembly, the Sovereign having
taken his Seat at the upper End of the Table, and given
leave to the Knights-Companions to sit, the Occasion
of their being call’d together is first declar’d either by
the Sovereign himself, or the Chancellor of the Order
by his Command.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> next thing in Course, is to exhibit to the Sovereign
Information of all the vacant Stalls; and if the
Sovereign chance to be in Foreign Parts, an Information
ought to be transmitted to him by his Deputy or Lieutenant;
but if in <i>England</i>, and present in the Chapter,
then to be presented him by the Chancellor, or in his
Absence by the Register, or other Officer of the Order.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>After</span> this they singly debate how the Place of the
defunct Knight shall be supply’d, and sometimes (where
two or more Stalls are found void) whether they shall
be all fill’d up at that time, or if not, how many Knights
shall be elected <i>pro hac vice</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>But</span> when the Scrutiny is intended to be taken in the
Choir of St. <i>George</i>’s Chapel at <i>Windsor</i>, these or the like
particulars (referring to Election) are commonly consider’d
of on the Feast-Day in the Chapter held immediately
before Vespers, wherein it is most usually order’d,
That the Scrutiny shall be taken in the Chapel that following
Afternoon. And so it was decreed on St. <i>George</i>’s
Day, <i>Anno</i> 5. <i>Edw.</i> VI. <i>viz.</i> <i>That the Elections of Knights
should be taken that Even-song in the Chapel</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>This</span> being effected, the Chancellor begins to collect
the Knights-Companions Votes, and this is frequently
term’d the taking the Scrutiny: For the ampler
<span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span>View of the Nature of which Action and Ceremony, we
shall proceed to certain Considerations preparatory thereunto,
beginning with what concerns the Nomination of
the Persons to be proposed to the Election.</p>

<p class='c008'>§. 6. <span class='sc'>And</span> first, That Knights-Companions only present
in Chapter, have the sole Right inherent in themselves,
to nominate and propose Persons to the Sovereign’s Election,
consentaneous to the Bodies of the Statutes,
that even from the Institution of this Most Noble Order,
it hath not ever suffer’d any deviations.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>It</span> is worthy of Remark, that <i>Anno</i> 26. <i>Eliz.</i> the
Feast of St. <i>George</i> being Celebrated at <i>Greenwich</i>, the
Earl of <i>Warwick</i>, and Lord <i>Burleigh</i> were seized with a
Fit of the Gout, upon the Feast Day, which retarded
them from Evening Prayer, whilst the Scrutiny was taken;
whereupon we find their Indisposition of Body,
and Absence, noted in that Scrutiny, where their Nominations
should else have been set down, had they been present.
And upon the same Occasion was what <i>Robert Cook</i>,
Esq; <i>Clarenceux</i>, King at Arms, informs us, <i>That as for
those Knights Companions who happen to be absent</i> when the
Scrutiny is taken, altho’ this Absence is <i>occasioned</i> by Accident
of Sickness, or with the Soveraign’s Licence, nevertheless,
<i>in regard of this their Absence at that very
time, their Votes may not be received</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Those Knights Companions that come late to the
Chapter, forfeit likewise the Privilege of giving their
Votes for that time, which so happened to Prince <i>Rupert</i>,
and the Earl of <i>Strafford</i>, at the Chapter held for the Election
of <i>James</i> Duke of <i>Monmouth</i>, in the Privy Chamber
at <i>Whitehall</i>, 29 <i>Mar.</i> 1663.</p>

<p class='c000'>Altho’ none of the absent Knights-Companions can give
a Proxy to vote, or otherwise send their Suffrages into
the Chapter or Chapel, there to pass in Nomination;
yet formerly, <i>circa temp. H.</i> 5. <i>&amp; H.</i> 6. when divers of
the Knights Companions were frequently employed in
the Wars of <i>France</i>, and consequently so fixed to their
Commands, that they could not personally attend the
Feast of St. <i>George</i> at <i>Windsor</i>, it was usual for the Commander
there in Chief, with Consent of those Knights
Companions, to make a formal Certificate, or Presentment
<span class='pageno' title='235' id='Page_235'></span>(but not to pass it by way of Nomination or Vote,
for that the Law of the Order did not permit) to the
Soveraign, or his Lieutenant and Knights Companions
assembled at the Feast, of such Persons famous for martial
Valour and Virtue, with an Account of their gallant
Acts and Atchievements, (attested by other Persons of
Honour) as were at that time, and in that Kingdom, in
the Sovereign’s Service, and seemed worthy Candidates
for the Honour of the Election, to the intent victorious
and brave Persons might be preferr’d to so noble and
sublime a Post; an Example whereof we find preserved
by the Industrious and Learned <i>Dugdale</i>.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_7 c007'>“My Lord the Duc of <i>Bedford</i> remembreth, as by the

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>But</span> lest it may be suppos’d by some, that the
Knights-Companions present in Chapter, can at their
<span class='pageno' title='237' id='Page_237'></span>pleasures nominate or propose to elect such Persons as
they deem meet, so they be qualify’d according to the
Statutes, this Privilege is to be understood of Knights Subjects
only: For in all Cases concerning Strangers, the
Sovereign doth but barely grant them Sufferance, and
may direct and confine the Knights-Companions to the
Nomination of such as he at any time intends to Honour
with Election, which Prerogative was particularly Asserted,
31 <i>Eliz.</i> and 3 <i>Car.</i> I.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> the First of these Instances, the <i>Blue Book</i>, of the
Order recordeth, That at a Chapter held immediately
before Vespers on St. <i>George</i>’s Day, the Earl of <i>Huntingdon</i>,
then Lieutenant for the Sovereign, made known to the
Knights-Companions, <i>That the Sovereign did permit them,
or leave it to their Pleasure to chuse into the Order whatsoever
Foreign Prince they should by their Votes approve of</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Here</span> we have two Points that offer themselves to
our Consideration. <i>First</i>, That the Knights-Companions
have not the Liberty to nominate what Foreign Prince
they please, but the same is derivative from the Sovereign,
and only by his Permission. <i>Secondly</i>, To weigh
the Paragraph well, that <i>Nominare</i> ought to be render’d
or understood here by the Word <i>Eligere</i>, and that
the Power delegated to the Knights-Companions from
the Sovereign, was only to nominate, not elect; For it
immediately follows, <i>That the Knights-Companions went
from the Chapter to the Second Vespers; and while the Divine
Offices were celebrating, the Prelate receiv’d their Nominations,
and that very Evening the Lieutenant presented them to the
Sovereign for her to consider of</i>; which had been insignificant
and useless, if the Knights-Companions had been
impower’d by her Licence to have made the Choice
themselves. But the contrary is evident; for the next
Morning, all the Knights-Companions attending the
Sovereign in Chapter, she herself confirm’d there the
Election not of any Foreign Prince, but of the Earl of
<i>Sussex</i>, and the Lord <i>Buckhurst</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> the other Instance, <i>Anno</i> 3 <i>Car.</i> I. the Sovereign in
a Chapter held before Vespers on St. <i>George</i>’s Day, signify’d
it to be his Pleasure (Three Stalls being then
vacant) that <i>out of Foreign Princes, the Nomination of whom</i>,
(saith the Annals in that very Place) <i>belongs only to the
<span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span>Sovereign</i>, i. e. The Sovereign has the Prerogative to direct
the Knights-Companions to name, or impose upon
them the Nomination of such Foreign Prince he pleaseth
they, the Knights-Companions, should pitch upon;
which must undoubtedly be understood to Nominate,
or enter down into the Scrutiny, (not elect) <i>Gustavus
Adolphus</i>, King of <i>Sweden</i>, and <i>Henry</i> Prince of <i>Orange</i>.
For a little after, it is evident, when the Scrutiny was
presented to the Sovereign, that himself, not the
Knights-Companions, made Election of them.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>And</span> it is further manifest, by the Scrutiny there inserted,
that both those Princes were named by every
of the Knights-Companions then present, according to
the Sovereign’s signification (which has been usually
done at all other Times upon the like Occasions.) But
concerning the third Person then to be Elected, the
Sovereign, (intending him to be a Knight-Subject) left
it entirely to their Pleasure to Nominate whomsoever
they thought worthy of their Votes. Since this Time,
the Nominations in like Cases, have been sufficiently
acknowledg’d by the Knights-Companions themselves,
to be a Prerogative belonging solely to the Sovereign.
For to the End they might more expeditiously and
clearly shew their Compliance, it was moved in a Chapter
held at <i>Oxford</i>, <i>March</i> the 2d. 19 <i>Car.</i> I. <i>That it might
become a Custom for the Sovereign to declare before-hand,
whether he would elect any Foreign Prince, and whom, that so
the Knights-Companions might be there to name him in the
Scrutiny</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>§. 7. <span class='sc'>Another</span> Consideration in our Progress towards
the Act of Election, is appertaining to the Number,
Qualifications and Dignities of the Persons nominated,
which may be more conspicuously resolved from another
Branch of the before-mention’d Article, <i>viz.</i> That every
one of the Knights-Companions present at the Election
should nominate for himself nine very sufficient Persons,
whom he should judge free from all Reproach and
Scandal, whether Subjects to the Sovereign, or Foreigners,
Provided they are known not to Favour or
Abet any Party at enmity with him; that is to say,
three Earls, or others of higher Degree, three Barons,
<span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span>and three Knights. Wherein the Things chiefly observable,
we rank under five Heads.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the First of these, their Number. Every Knight-Companion
assembl’d in Chapter, is injoin’d to name
Nine, neither more nor less. So also saith King <i>Henry</i> V’s
Statutes. Nor are King <i>Henry</i> VIIIth’s. any ways dissonant.
And in this particular, the Statutes have been
hitherto inviolably observed, except in one Case. As to
Numbers, and the Mysteries wrapt up in them, we shall
not further insist upon. But why our Royal Founder
selected this particular Number above all other, unless
he had some Eye, and tacit Reflection on the Nine
Worthies, or a treble threefold Cord and Symbol of
perfect Stability and solid Amity, the Number Nine is
accounted to signifie, can with no great Facility or
Certainty be decypher’d.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the Second Point, they ought to be of unspotted
Character. The Injunction in the Statutes of
Institution takes Order, that the Persons designed for
Election, should be <i>free from all Reproach, and of untaintted
Reputation</i>; and according to those of King <i>Henry</i> V.
are to be <i>the best and most sufficient Knights, and freest from
Reproach</i>. To the same purpose the Exemplar in the
Black-Book, <i>Such as are fittest</i>, and whom they who
Nominate <i>believe to be free from Ignominy and Dishonour</i>.
And to this Act of Nomination belongs part of the
Second Article in <i>Henry</i> VIIIth’s Statutes, <i>That no
Knight-Companion should name any Person whom he thinks or
esteems in his Conscience to have upon him any Spot of Reproach</i>.
But on the Contrary in another Place of the same Statutes
it is Provided, That they be nominated and proposed
<i>out of the Number of the most worthy and select
Knights</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>How tender the Knights-Companions were in pristine
Times of infringing this particular, is proved
from a notable Passage which happen’d <i>Ann.</i> 39 <i>Hen.</i> VI.
at a Scrutiny taken the 8th of <i>February</i>, in the Bishop of
<i>London</i>’s Palace, where <i>John de Foix</i> Earl of <i>Kendal</i>, a
<i>Gascoigner</i> by birth, (which makes the Example more
eminent, that a Stranger should have so great Regard
to the Honour of the Order) not being acquainted with
the Quality and Merit of Knights and Honourable Persons
<span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span>amongst us so well and demonstrably as to nominate
such whom he was confident were irreprehensible,
forbore to mention any Persons at all. And certainly,
seeing the Statutes put very considerable Qualifications
upon the Deputies and Proxies, made choice for the
Installation of Strangers (as elsewhere shown) much
more Caution and Regard ought to be used both in the
Nomination and Election of Knights into this radiant
and illustrious Society.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> third Head the Statutes render indifferently
capable of being nominated or elected, either Knights Subjects,
or Strangers, [Free Princes or their Subjects.]
And it was so even at the Election upon the first Choice,
where among the Twenty five Elected Knights, Twenty
three of them were Subjects. And this was the constant
Custom not only in the remaining Part of the Founders
Reign, and during those of his three Successors, but
has continued ever since, as appears from the Scrutinies
taken and entred throughout the Annals of the Order.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Of</span> those who have gain’d admission into this Noble
Order by Election, we shall in the last Chapter give an
Account in a compleat Catalogue of them, and likewise
insert the Names of such as have missed their Election,
yet are not to be buried in Oblivion, out of this very respect,
that by their standing Candidates, have the
Fame of being enrolled in the Principal Register of
Honour now in the Christian World. It cannot be
supposed we should give a List of all, (for that were a
Task too laborious, and wou’d prove too numerous) but
only of those of eminent Quality in foreign Parts, with
the Æra when the Scrutinies were taken.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Those</span> Persons were render’d incapable of Nomination
who were known to Act in contrary Interest to the Sovereign;
as the <i>Exemplar</i> in the <i>Black-Book</i> expresseth
more copiously, <i>Such as are not his Adversaries, or Abettors,
or willing Defenders of his Adversaries</i>. Sometimes the
Knights-Companions being more wary and discreet in
Nominating them, to put either disrespect upon the
Sovereign, or offer Violation to the Statutes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> the last Place, concerning the Degree, Rank and
Dignity of the Nine Knights proposed to be Elected, the
Statutes of the Institution set forth, That they be, <i>First</i>,
Three <i>Earls</i>, or Persons of great Dignity. <i>Secondly</i>,
Three <i>Barons</i>. And, <i>Thirdly</i>, Three <i>Knights</i>: Or, as it
<span class='pageno' title='242' id='Page_242'></span>is in <i>Henry</i> V’s Statutes, <i>Trois Contes ou de greegnear estat,
trois Banerets, &amp; trois Batchelers</i>. These Degrees are to
be ranked in Three Classes, and they distinguish’d by
Three Divisions, all including the Three Degrees
aforesaid.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Whereas</span> all other Bodies and Exemplars of the
Statutes make positive mention of Earls only, yet the
Statutes of <i>Hen.</i> VIII. in this Point are more ample, by
expressing the first Class, <i>Dukes</i>, <i>Marquesses</i>, and <i>Earls</i>,
or <i>Persons superior</i> to these in Degree, wherein the highest
Dignity is comprehended.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>We</span> may observe the different Title, <i>viz.</i> <i>Baneret</i>
that <i>Henry</i> V’s Statutes hath given us instead of <i>Baron</i>;
and not only in this Article, but in all other where
there is Occasion to treat of Barons; and yet the Record
intends by it no other than the Person it mentions:
For tho’ a Banneret had its Denomination <i>à vexillo</i>, it
usually signify’d a Degree of Honour next below a Baron,
both in a later and a modern Date; yet formerly
among our Records, it is expressedly Synonymous to Baron,
as is sufficiently clear’d up by our most Learned
<i>Selden</i>; and in this Sense is to be taken here, and not
as a distinct Title of lower Degree, because we observe
the Bannerets rank’d in all Scrutinies before King <i>Henry</i>
VIII. establish’d his Statutes (except one) with the
Knights-Batchelors, not with Barons.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Title of the third and lowest Rank in this
Classis in the Statutes of their Institution, are called
<i>Milites Bachalauri</i>, and in those of King <i>Henry</i> V. <i>Batchelors</i>,
and elsewhere <i>Bachalauri &amp; Bachelauri Equites</i>, which
in common Acceptation are the same with <i>Milites</i>, tho’
thus render’d to evince their difference from Knights-Bannerets,
who are of a superior Degree of Honour.
And here we may observe, that there is no Place in a
Scrutiny for any under the Degree of a Knight-Batchelor.
And tho’ Three of the Nine mentioned are set
down to be Barons, and Three other Earls, or of higher
Degree, yet must these Six be such as have had conferred
on them the Order of Knighthood, else their Names
are rejected, and neither given or taken in Nomination;
for the Words of the Statute expresly are, <i>That each of
the Knights assembl’d at the Election shall name nine Knights</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span><span class='sc'>Thus</span> King <i>Charles</i> I. <i>Anno</i> 6 <i>Regni sui</i>, designing to
invest <i>James</i> Marquess of <i>Hamilton</i> with this Order, conferr’d
the Honour of Knighthood upon him immediately
before his Nomination: And the Annals in that
Place put this commentary Remark thereupon, <i>Because
by the Statutes it is provided, that none should be elected into
the Order that have not been dignify’d with the Title of Knight</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Yet</span> the Ceremony of Knighting the Person designed
to be elected, was not so strictly regarded, but sometimes
this Branch of the Statute was either wholly passed,
or else confounded with the second Article throughout
the several Bodies of the Statutes, which prohibits
the Choice or Election of any Person into the Society,
as this doth the Proposal or Nomination. And thereupon
perhaps it was conceiv’d, that altho’ the Nomination,
Election, and sometimes Delivery of the Ensigns
of the Order was first dispatch’d and past, yet it was
sufficient if the Honour of Knighthood was conferr’d
afterwards; as in the Cases of <i>William</i> Earl of <i>Derby</i> and
<i>Thomas</i> Lord <i>Burleigh</i>, <i>Anno</i> 43. <i>Eliz.</i> where the Register
observes, That as soon as their Election was over,
and they Usher’d into the Chapter, the Earl of <i>Derby</i>,
(who it seems had not been Knighted before) was dubbed
Knight with a drawn Sword, according to Custom,
after which they had the Garter and George put on by
the Sovereign her self.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> like manner, <i>Ulrick</i> Duke of <i>Holstein</i>, and <i>Henry</i>
Earl of <i>Northampton</i>, immediately after their Election,
(the last Day of St. <i>George</i>’s Feast, <i>Ann.</i> 3. <i>Jac.</i> I.) and
before they receiv’d the Ensigns of the Order, had the
Dignity of Knighthood conferr’d on them by the Sovereign;
and in like manner the Earl of <i>Sussex</i>, <i>Ann.</i> 3 <i>C.</i> I.
which the <i>Red-Book</i> of the Order recites, <i>That as soon as
it was understood that the Earl had not receiv’d the Order of
Knighthood before, the Sovereign immediately drawing his
Sword, Knighted him</i>; which was not done till after his
Election and Investiture with both the George and
Garter.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Thus</span> did the Ceremony of Knighthood succeed the
Election of <i>Charles</i> Prince of <i>Wales</i>, the 21st of <i>May</i>,
<i>Ann.</i> 14 <i>Car.</i> I. for after he had been elected, and invested
with the Ensigns of the Order by the two Senior
<span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span>Knights (the Earls of <i>Pembroke</i> and <i>Montgomery</i>, and of
<i>Arundel</i> and <i>Surry</i>) were intreated by the rest of the
Knights-Companions, to present his Highness to the
Sovereign in the Name of all the rest, to be initiated a
Knight-Batchelor. He was conducted by the said Earls
(his Supporters) into the Presence-Chamber in <i>Windsor-Castle</i>,
where before the Chair of State, he most Solemnly
receiv’d the Order of Knighthood from his Father
King <i>Charles</i> I.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>To</span> Honour which Knighthood, and the Memory
thereof, Four of the chief Nobility then present were
Knighted, <i>viz.</i> the Earls of <i>Essex</i>, <i>St. Alban</i>’s and <i>Elgin</i>,
and Viscount <i>Grandison</i>, being conducted from the Great
Chamber to the Sovereign’s State, each between two
Batchelor-Knights.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Afterwards</span> the Law in this Point began again to
be more rightly understood; and by that Time <i>James</i>
Duke of <i>York</i> came to be elected (which was the 20th
of <i>April</i>, 18 <i>Car.</i> I. at the Feast of St. <i>George</i> celebrated at
<i>York</i>) the Sovereign appointed, and accordingly conferr’d
Knighthood upon him the Day before, which he
receiv’d upon his Knees, being conducted into the Presence-Chamber
between two of the Nobility, who were
also Knights, the Marquess of <i>Hertford</i> and Viscount
<i>Grandison</i>. In Honour and Commemoration whereof,
Four other Noblemen receiv’d the Honour of Knighthood
at that time, the Earl of <i>Carnarvan</i>, the Lords
<i>George D’Aubignie</i>, <i>John Stewart</i>, and <i>Bernard Stewart</i>, each
supported by two Knights.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>And</span> thus Prince <i>Edward</i> Count Palatine of the <i>Rhine</i>,
and <i>George</i> Duke of <i>Buckingham</i>, being designed by
King <i>Charles</i> II. to be admitted into this Noble Order,
were both first Knighted at St. <i>Germains</i> in <i>France</i>, 1649.
and afterwards had the Ensigns of the Order sent unto
them, by the Hands of Sir <i>Edward Walker</i>, Kt. Garter,
who, in right of his Office, invested them therewith.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Yet</span> in the Case of Prince <i>Rupert</i>, who was elected
with <i>James</i> Duke of York, <i>Ann.</i> 18. <i>Car.</i> I. His want of
Knighthood became no impediment, because he was a
Prince in another Country, <i>viz.</i> Count <i>Palatine</i> of the
<i>Rhine</i>, and Duke of <i>Bavaria</i>, and might therefore justly
challenge a Privilege to come within the Rule of
foreign Princes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='245' id='Page_245'></span><span class='sc'>But</span> the Sovereign, to arrive as near to the Intention
and Observance of the Statute as he could, (where there
was a possibility to do it, and the Honour would be
well accepted by the Prince) thought it requisite by
Commission under the Great Seal of <i>England</i>, to impower
<i>Thomas</i> Earl of <i>Arundel</i> and <i>Surry</i>, and <i>George</i> Lord
<i>Goring</i>, both being then in <i>Holland</i>, or either of them, to
Knight the said Prince before putting on the Garter
(seeing it could not possibly be done before his Election)
which was intended to be sent by him by the Hands of
Sir <i>John Burrough</i>, Garter. But Death intervening, the
Sovereign’s Intention was frustrated; altho’ the Prince,
upon his coming afterwards into <i>England</i>, receiv’d both
the Garter and the George from the Sovereign himself at
<i>Nottingham</i> nevertheless without Knighthood, which to
excuse, it may well be alledg’d, that the Sovereign might
not recollect this Part of the Ceremony, it being a Time
of so great Turmoil and Fatigue, occasion’d by the then
setting up of his Standard.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>However</span>, upon the 17th of <i>January</i>, 1644. when a
Decree past in Chapter then assembl’d at <i>Oxford</i>, That
both the Duke of <i>York</i> and the Prince, should enjoy all
Emoluments and Privileges of the Order, tho’ they
were not as yet Install’d (which Ceremony was to be
compleated assoon as <i>Windsor</i> was out of the Power of
the Rebels.) The Prince, before he receiv’d his Oath,
was conducted by the Earl of <i>Berk-shire</i> and Duke of
<i>Richmond</i> and <i>Lenox</i>, unto the Sovereign, and had conferr’d
on him the Honour of Knighthood, there being
at the same Time two of the Nobility Knighted in Memorial
of that Solemnity, the Lord <i>Henry Seymour</i>, Second
Son to the Marquess of <i>Hertford</i>, and the Lord
<i>Capell</i>, conducted each between two Knights.</p>

<p class='c008'>§. 8. <span class='sc'>We</span> are now come to speak of the Scrutiny it
self, in reference to which, we shall consider by whom
it ought, or hath been usually taken, and the Manner
and Form thereof.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>By</span> the Statutes of the Institution, the Collecting the
Knights-Companions Votes, and entring them in the
Scrutiny, solely appertains to the Prelate of the Order;
and upon him is this Office devolved, not only by the
<span class='pageno' title='246' id='Page_246'></span>other Bodies of the Statutes, but by the Constitutions
of his Post, and the Obligation of his Oath, whose right
we find duly asserted upon this Persons taking a Scrutiny,
<i>Anno</i> 29 <i>Eliz.</i></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Statutes likewise provided, That if the Prelate
was at any Time absent, then the Dean of <i>Windsor</i>, or
the Register, or the Senior Residentiary of the College,
or the Secretary, or Scribe of the Order, should undertake
the Employment; and elsewhere it is mention’d
expressly, <i>In the absence of the Prelate, whose particular Duty
otherwise it was</i>. And among the various Examples enroll’d
in the Annals of the Order, these Examples abundantly
confirm it. The Prelate of the Order collected
the Suffrages from the Knights-Companions, <i>Anno</i>
9 <i>Hen.</i> V. when <i>John</i> Earl-Marshal, and Four other
Knights were elected. The like did <i>Henry Beaufort</i>, Lord-Cardinal,
Prelate of the Order, upon the Election of
<i>John</i> King of <i>Portugal</i>, <i>Anno</i> 13 <i>Hen.</i> VI. And when the
Duke of <i>Suffolk</i> was chose, <i>Anno</i> 26 <i>Hen.</i> VI. the Prelate
then also gather’d the Suffrages; which he likewise did
upon the Feasts of St. <i>George</i>, Celebrated in the 12th,
13th, 14th, 27th, 28th, 30th, 31th, 34th and 35th
Years of Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>’s Reign. Sometimes the Scrutinies
have been gathered both by the Dean of <i>Windsor</i>,
and the Register of the Order jointly; as we find by the
Election of <i>John</i> Lord <i>Talbot</i>, <i>Ann.</i> 2 <i>Hen.</i> VI. of Sir
<i>John Falstaff</i>, <i>Ann.</i> 6 <i>Hen.</i> VI. and the Duke of <i>Quinbery</i>,
<i>Ann.</i> 5 <i>Hen.</i> VI. all receiv’d at the Feasts of St. <i>George</i>,
celebrated at <i>Windsor</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>It</span> is more than a bare Conjecture, that the Dean at
those Times receiv’d the Votes from the Knights-Companions
on the Sovereign’s side, while the Register collected
those on the Prince’s; for ’tis observ’d, that in
King <i>Henry</i> Vth’s Reign, in Posts of different Natures,
one whereof was to signifie the Sovereign’s Pleasure to
the Knights-Companions about their paying due Reverence,
first to God, and afterwards to himself; and the
other in a Ceremonial, which directs the Manner and
Order of Mulcting the Knights-Companions; in both
which, the Dean perform’d the Service on the right
Hand the Choir (the Sovereign’s side) and the Register
on the left.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span><span class='sc'>Sometimes</span> the Register of the Order took them
alone, as at the Election of <i>John</i> Earl of <i>Arundel</i>, <i>Anno</i>
10 <i>Hen.</i> VI. and those of the Earl of <i>Morteyn</i> and Sir
<i>John Grey</i>, <i>Ann.</i> 14 <i>Hen.</i> VI. Moreover it’s plain, that
when the Office of Register was not fill’d, and <i>Thomas
Ruthall</i>, Bishop of <i>Duresme</i>, executed it during its Vacancy,
the Bishop himself, <i>Ann.</i> 2 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. collected
the Suffrages. The like did <i>William Day</i>, Dean of
<i>Windsor</i>, in the Absence of <i>George Carew</i>, Dean of the
Chapel and Register of the Order, at the Feasts of
St. <i>George</i> held at <i>Whitehall</i>, <i>Anno</i> 18 and 19 <i>Eliz.</i></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>This</span> Duty was executed by the Register from the
15th Year of King <i>Henry</i> VIII. to the Period of his and
his Son’s Reign, as the <i>Black-Book</i> of the Order fully
evinces; as also on St. <i>George</i>’s Day, <i>Ann.</i> 1. <i>Eliz.</i> by
<i>John Boxhall</i>; and at the Feast of St. <i>George</i> held <i>Ann.</i>
1 <i>Jac.</i> I. by <i>Giles Thompson</i>, who in the several Times
were Registers, yet we must not mistake that what they
officiated was on their own behalf, but supply’d the
Place of the Prelate.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> the Beginning of Queen <i>Mary</i>’s Reign, we find
the Chancellor of the Order began to perform this Service,
being by King <i>Henry</i> VIIIth’s Statutes adjoined to
those other Offices before describ’d, to collect the Scrutinies
in absence of the Prelate, and thereby made capable
of the Employment, which afterwards is tacitly
remark’d to be perform’d as if in his own right, when
the Register has only effected it in the Chancellor’s absence,
tho’ in reality it was no other, than as in the
Instance of the Bishop of <i>Duresme</i> and Dr. <i>Day</i> aforesaid,
who took the Scrutiny in the Vacancy of the Office,
and absence of the Register.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Anno</i> 4 <i>Eliz.</i> the Register in the Absence of the Chancellor
(who was sick,) upon the Feast Day of St. <i>George</i>,
collected the Suffrages. And <i>Ann.</i> 8. <i>Eliz.</i> <i>George Carew</i>,
then Register of the Order, <i>took the Votes of the Knights-Companions
in absence of Sir</i> William Petre, <i>Chancellor of
the Order</i>. So also <i>Ann.</i> 4. <i>Jac.</i> I. where the Cause of
the Chancellor’s Absence is noted to be Sickness, and
<i>Ann.</i> 6. <i>Jac.</i> I. to be Death.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> the first of these Instances, we find the Prelate expressly
set down to be there; in the two following, his
<span class='pageno' title='248' id='Page_248'></span>presence is implyed, for it is said, that the Four Officers of
the Order did attend both Feasts, whereof, (the Chancellor
being wanting) the Prelate must needs be one.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Now</span> all these Passages seem to relate to the Right
of the Chancellors rather than the Prelates by this Remark,
That every of the Scrutinies were taken in the
Absence of the Chancellor, which looks something like
a cautionary Remark that denoted the Right of <a id='executing' name='executing'></a>Executing
this Office to the Chancellor, rather than the
Prelate.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>When</span> a Deputy-Chancellor hath been admitted to
Officiate in the Chancellor’s absence, he, and not the
Prelate, hath taken the Scrutiny, (tho’ present) as at
the Election of <i>Charles</i> Prince of <i>Wales</i>, the 20th of
<i>May</i>, 14 <i>Car.</i> I. and at another taken the 22d of <i>May</i>
following, and the same when the Suffrages were collected
for the Election of the Duke of <i>York</i> and Prince
<i>Rupert</i> at <i>York</i>, <i>Anno</i> 17 <i>Car.</i> I.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>But</span> there is one Passage more (upon taking a Scrutiny
<i>Anno</i> 22 <i>Jac.</i> I.) which seems Advantageous to the
Chancellor in this Point, where it is said, <i>That when the
Knights-Companions had given their Votes</i> (as say the <i>Annals</i>)
<i>THE CHANCELLOR WHO, ACCORDING TO HIS
OFFICE, was to receive them, presented them to the Sovereign</i>.
Howbeit, in truth there is no sufficient Foundation for
the Register to insert this as done by the Chancellor, <i>by
Virtue of his Office</i>, or any one Act or Chapter that hath
suspended or made void, the Right of the Prelate,
which is reserved by him, even by the Patent, for erecting
the Office of Chancellor; especially in those Affairs,
which, respecting the Order, ought by the Statute
of the Institution to appertain to him. But since the
stated Time of performing this Ceremony in the Chapel,
the Prelate (if present) is presumed to be Officiating
at the Altar, in discharge of another part of his
Duty, upon this consideration hath the Service been
then imposed upon the Chancellor, and others.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Lastly</i>, <span class='sc'>We</span> find the Scrutiny to be once taken by
Garter, <i>Ann.</i> 16. <i>Car.</i> I. at the Election of <i>Thomas</i> Earl
of <i>Strafford</i>. But this was at a Time, when not only
the Prelate, but all the other Officers of the Order, excepting
Sir <i>John Burrough</i>, Garter, were absent, and consequently
<span class='pageno' title='249' id='Page_249'></span>this Service so executed, ought rather to be
judged to have been done in the Prelate’s than Chancellor’s
Right.</p>

<p class='c008'>§. 9. <span class='sc'>But</span> whosoever gather’d the Suffrages, the
Time when they enter’d upon this Duty (in the Intervals
of Feasts, where the Occasion requir’d a peculiar
Chapter for an Election) was usually after the Chapter
had been open’d, and the Matter of Election proposed
by the Sovereign; after which he proceeded with all
possible Reverence and Respect.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Howbeit</span> upon an extraordinary Occasion (in the
Interval of the Grand Feasts) the Sovereign hath sometimes
called an Assembly of the Knights Companions,
to be convened at the Castle of <i>Windsor</i>, who in the
Choire of St. <i>George</i>’s Chapel (not Chapter-House) after
the more solemn Manner, have deliver’d in their Nominations,
and returning thence into the Chapter-House,
he there continu’d the Election. Thus did King <i>Henry</i>
VIII. upon the 7th of <i>June</i> in the 17th Year of his
Reign, in reference to the Election of the Lord <i>Henry Fitz
Roy</i>, (so stil’d in the Scrutiny, and rank’d among the
Barons; for as yet he was not created Duke of <i>Somerset</i>
and <i>Richmond</i>) and <i>Ralph Nevil</i>, Earl of <i>Westmorland</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>On</span> the 20th of <i>May</i>, <i>Anno</i> 14 <i>Car.</i> I. being <i>Trinity-Sunday</i>,
the Sovereign caus’d a Chapter to be held
that Afternoon in the Chapter-House at <i>Windsor</i>,
for the Nomination and Election of <i>Charles</i> Prince
of <i>Wales</i>; at the Breaking up whereof, the Sovereign
and Knights-Companions proceeded immediately
to St. <i>Georges</i>’s Chapel, where at Evening-Prayer,
(which was not within the Compass of the Feast, for
that began not ’till next Day) the Scrutiny was taken.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>And</span> besides those Examples which shew the Nominations
have been collected (upon peculiar Occasions)
in the Choire at <i>Windsor</i>, there are one or two Instances
they have been also taken in the Chapel at <i>Whitehall</i>, as
on the 15th of <i>May</i>, <i>Ann.</i> 1 <i>Car.</i> I. at the Choice of
<i>Edmund</i> Earl of <i>Dorset</i>, <i>Henry</i> Earl of <i>Holland</i>, and <i>Thomas</i>
Viscount <i>Andover</i>, as on the 4th of <i>July</i> the same Year,
whereat the Duke of <i>Chevereux</i> was pitch’d upon.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='250' id='Page_250'></span><span class='sc'>The</span> Suffrages have commonly been collected at the
Second Vespers, or in the Time of Evening-Prayer on
St. <i>George</i>’s Day, or on that Day whereon the Feast of
St. <i>George</i> hath been celebrated by Prorogation; and
with this Distinction of Time, the taking of divers Scrutinies
are mark’d.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>However</span>, there occurs one Scrutiny gather’d in the
Chapter-House at <i>Windsor</i> on the Eve of the Grand-Feast,
at which the person immediately elected, was
sent for in, and had the Ensigns of the Order conferr’d
upon him, when immediately the Sovereign made his
Progression to the Chapel, and after some small Interval,
the Elect proceeded to his Installation. And this was
the Case of <i>James</i> Marquess <i>Hamilton</i>, <i>Ann.</i> 6 <i>Car.</i> I.
who lying under an Obligation to commence his Voyage
next Morning towards <i>Germany</i> (whither he had
the Commission of General of 6000 Foot in Assistance
of the King of <i>Sweden</i>) occasion’d this his Sovereign’s
Indulgence, and quick dispatch.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>When</span> the Scrutiny first began to be collected in the
Chapel, is treated of somewhat general and indefinite.
<i>Ann.</i> 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9 <i>Eliz.</i> it was during the time of
<i>Evening-Prayer</i>. And in like manner, <i>Ann.</i> 4 <i>Jac.</i> I. and
13 <i>Car.</i> I. And when the Feast of St. <i>George</i> was solemniz’d
at <i>Whitehall</i>, the 18th of <i>April</i>, 13 <i>Car.</i> I. the <i>Annals</i>
say, <i>That the Sovereign recreated himself with the Melody
of Evensong, during which the Chancellor collected the Votes of
the Knights-Companions</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>But</span> in some other Places, the Time when this Matter
was transacted is restricted to a precise Time, or some
particular Part of Evening Prayer, as <i>Anno</i> 26 and 27
<i>Eliz.</i> <i>whilst the Choire sung the Service</i>, and the like
<i>Anno</i> 14 <i>Jac.</i> I. but 4 <i>Car.</i> I. <i>while the Anthem was sung
after the second Lesson</i>, but more frequently after the first
Lesson, as in the 2 and 9 <i>Car.</i> I. <i>while the Anthem was singing</i>,
or whilst they were hymning the Anthem of the
blessed <i>Virgin called the Magnificat</i>, and which is all one
with that, <i>Anno</i> 14 <i>Car.</i> I. viz. <i>assoon as the first Lesson was
read</i>, or <i>at the first Lesson</i>, which is remembred to be
<i>the usual Part of the Service, in which the nomination ought
to begin</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' title='251' id='Page_251'></span>§. 10. <span class='sc'>The</span> manner of the Order the Knight-Companions
Votes ought to be collected when the <i>Scrutiny is
taken in the Choire</i>, when the Register informs us, upon the
Celebration of St. <i>Georges</i>’s Feast at <i>Greenwich</i>, 28
<i>Hen.</i> VIII. as entred into the Black Book; “That he
used his Diligence in going to and fro from one Side to
the other, to demand and redemand the Suffrages from
the Knights-Companions, according to the Variety
and Disposition of their Stalls,” which same Methods
<i>in eisdem terminis</i> the Chancellor observed, <i>Anno</i> 24
<i>Eliz.</i> and without question was generally performed
at other Seasons, for the annals describe it to be perform’d
<i>de more</i> 5 Eliz. or <i>juxta Ordines Constitutionis</i> Anno
26 <i>Eliz.</i></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>That</span> the Officer who collects the Scrutiny, is obliged
to begin at the youngest Knight-Companion, and so
proceed upward towards the Eldest, is evident from
the Order mentioned to be in Vogue, <i>An.</i> 2 and 20 <i>Eliz.</i>
as also 15 <i>Car.</i> I. But to give a more particular Account
of this Ceremony, as it stood <i>temp. Car.</i> I. and doubtless
long before, tho’ not Recorded <i>in Scriptis</i>, is as follows.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>First</i>, <span class='sc'>The</span> Officer arose and went into the Middle of
the Choire; directly over against his own Seat, he
made two Reverences, first towards the high Altar, and
next to the Sovereign, then he proceeded up to the
Choire near the <i>hault pace</i> against the Stall of the junior
Knight-Companion, and there made like Reverence;
this done he went up to the Stall of the said junior
Knight, and with a singular Reverence to him, only demanded
whom he pleased to nominate, which having
taken, (making to him a second Reverence,) he descended
into the Choire, and thence passed to the next senior
Knight on the other Side, (unless by reason of the vacancy
of the Stall he Sits on the same Side with the junior)
and having received his nomination from the second
Knight-Companion, he again crossed the Choire to the
Third, and in like <a id='manner' name='manner'></a>manner he ascended according to
the Seniority of the Knights-Companions present, (always
crossing the Choire where there was occasion)
until he arrived at the senior Knight-Companion; and
<span class='pageno' title='252' id='Page_252'></span>having thus received all their Nominations, he returned
into the Middle of the Choire, and after accustomed
Reverences, took his Seat.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>This</span> Method in collecting the Votes as to the general,
and in the Choire, ought likewise to be observed when
they are taken from the Knights-Companions in Chapter,
they being ranked in due order on either Side of the
Table, according to the Seniority of their Elections
and situations of Stalls in the Choire; the Officer beginning
with the junior and thence gradually ascending
to the senior Knight.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>And</span> that we may rightly apprehend after what form
every Knight-Companion Ranketh the Names of those
Persons he proposeth, and how each Classis is distinguished
and divided, the following Scrutiny will manifest
which was taken off, <i>May</i>, <i>Anno</i> 13 <i>Hen.</i> VI. upon the
Vacancy of one Stall hapning by the death of Sir <i>Henry
Tanke Clux</i> a <i>German</i>, and the first Scrutiny found Marshalled
among the Annals of this most noble Order.</p>

is Stiled <i>Comes Averentiæ</i>) is by a mistake Ranked;
but in the second Division among the Barons,
and twice among the Knights Votes of the Marquess of
<i>Suffolk</i>, and Earl of <i>Shrewsbury</i>, but this Error perhaps
owes its original for want of due knowledge, either of the
Law in the Statutes or his Degree, the latter of which
is the most feasible to conjecture; for being a Stranger,
his Title might not be so generally divulged, nor is it
taken notice of in the Scrutiny itself, tho’ in the annals
immediately after it was rectified.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>And</span> to shew the probability of this Point, the Earls of
<i>Oxford</i>, <i>Devonshire</i>, and <i>Arundel</i>, (whose degrees were
sufficiently known) at a Scrutiny taken <i>Anno</i> 24 <i>Hen.</i> VI.
are ranked in the second Division among the Barons,
and <i>Anno</i> 1 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. the Earl of <i>Darby</i> is three Times
so placed, and again 13 <i>Hen.</i> VI. the Earl of <i>Devonshire</i>
twice; but this happened not thro oversight or neglect
of the Statutes, but because at these Nominations
wherein they are so Ranked, the first Division to which
they appertained, happened to be fill’d up with those
other higher Dignities belonging to the same Class, <i>viz.</i>
<span class='pageno' title='254' id='Page_254'></span>Kings or Dukes, as when the beforementioned Earls of
<i>Oxford</i>, <i>Devonshire</i>, and <i>Arundel</i>, were set down in the
Place of Barons; the King of <i>Portugal</i>, the Dukes of
<i>Warwick</i> and <i>Norfolk</i>, were put in the Class of Princes,
and so it happened in many other instances.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>On</span> the contrary, <i>Anno</i> 15 and 16 <a id='edw' name='edw'></a><i>Edw.</i> IV. the Lord
<i>Rich. Grey</i> one of the Queen’s Sons, by her former Husband,
Sir <i>John Grey</i> of <i>Groby</i> Knight; in respect of his
Alliance to the Royal Family, is Ranked in the first Division
among the Princes, under the Title <i>Dominus
Richardus filius Reginæ</i>, and afterwards <i>Anno</i> 19 <i>Edw.</i> IV.
set only among the Barons, as well with the former
Title as this <i>Richardus Dominus Grey</i>, but <i>Anno</i> 22 <i>Edw.</i> IV.
he is thrice register’d among the Princes, and as often
with the Barons, whence it is observable that to be
Enrolled in the Rank of Princes, may be afforded of
courtesie to Persons of high Eminency and Blood; but
then as they can lay no claim to it by their Merit, so
such of the Knights-Companions as Rank them lower,
suffer no diminution in their Honour.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Wherein</span> the second Division are Ranked the Barons
and Viscounts, for Viscounts in all Scrutinies, after
the first Erection of that Dignity, were on the same
level with the Barons, until the 3 of <i>Jac.</i> I. (excepting
only <i>John Dudley</i> Viscount <i>Lisle</i>, <i>Anno</i> 35 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. who
by every Knight, the Duke of <i>Norfolk</i> excepted, is
Ranked in the first Division of Princes) and in a Scrutiny
then taken, <i>Robt. Cecil</i> Viscount <i>Craneborne</i> is the second
Viscount in the List that has been Ranked with
Princes, whence it became the frequent Practice in
succeeding Scrutinies, until <i>Anno</i> 14 <i>Car.</i> I. And then
(upon a Question put in Chapter convened at <i>Westminster</i>
23 <i>May</i> 14. <i>Car.</i> I.) whether Earls Sons and Viscounts
were eligible with Barons, it passed in the affirmative,
and that by general usage except in the two cases just
mentioned; and about the same time we find it reiterated
near that Time, for in two Scrutinies taken the
19th and 21st of that Instant <i>May</i>, the Viscounts are
therein reduced to the second Division, and Ranked
with the Barons.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The</span> Knights-Batchelors and Bannerets held the same
<span class='pageno' title='255' id='Page_255'></span>Rank in King <i>Hen.</i> VIII’s Statutes, in all Scrutinies with
Barons.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>But</span> tho’ the word in King <i>Hen.</i> VIIIth’s late Statutes
is <i>Baronettus</i> instead of <i>Banerettus</i>, yet is this frequently
obvious in some ancient Books and Records, as
well as in those ancient Writers, long before the Title
of Baronet was conceived or brought into use.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>In</span> the last place he who demands those Suffrages (the
Knights-Companions present) is by the Statutes of Institution
to receive them in writing; for in a Scrutiny
taken <i>Anno</i> 2 <i>Hen.</i> VI. at the Election of <i>John</i> Lord
<i>Talbote</i> and <i>Turnival</i>, the Dean of <i>Windsor</i>, and the
Register of the Order, <i>wrote down the Votes and Nominations
of every singular Knight present at the Day of Election</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>And</span> at another Scrutiny <i>Anno</i> 4 <i>Hen.</i> VI. to fill up
that which by an Error in the Black Book is set down
Sir <i>Henry Fitzhugh</i>, ’tis inserted, <i>That the Dean and Register
wrote down in Order</i>, (according to their Seniority) <i>the
Votes of the Knights-Companions</i>. And after the Scrutinies
began to be entred in the Annals, it is evident the
general Practice kept pace with the Injunction of the
Statutes; only there are two instances of an Election
confirmed without taking a Scrutiny in writing, one in
the case of the Princes <i>Henry</i> and <i>Christiern</i> IV. King of
<i>Denmark</i>, where the Knights-Companions in a Chapter
convened at <i>Whitehall</i>, 14 of <i>July</i> 1 <i>Jac.</i> I. gave in their
Votes <i>viva voce</i>, and immediately the Sovereign admitted
them both into the Illustrious Society; the other was
the Case of <i>James</i> Marquis <i>Hamilton</i>, Elected the 2d of
<i>Feb.</i> 20 <i>Jac.</i> I. with the vocal consent of all the Knights-Companions.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>It</span> is worthy observation, that this Method, and
the omission of taking the Scrutiny in writing, is not only
contrary to the Law of the Order expressly set down
for a more stable consignation of the Action, and more
faithful transmission of it to Posterity, but exceeding
prejudicial to Persons of Honour, and Distinction, whose
Names would otherwise survive with great veneration
among the candidates of this Illustrious Order, and of
which Honour many deserving Persons will be hereafter
deprived, if the Injunctions of the Statutes be not
observed in this particular respect.</p>

  <span class='pageno' title='256' id='Page_256'></span>
<h3 class='c010'>SECT. XI.<br /> <br /><i>The Presentation of it to the Sovereign.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_6 c014'>THE Knights-Companions, having delivered their
Suffrages, the Officer by whom they are Collected,
humbly presents to the Sovereign the Nominations,
for so it is recorded the Prelate of the Order acted in the
9th of <i>Hen.</i> the Vth. If these Votes were taken in
Chapter, the Paper usually was immediately presented
to the Sovereign who made his Election, before the
Chapter broke up; but if gathered in the Chapel,
tho’ it was given to the Sovereign, yet the choice was
not made then, but the Morning after, and this was the
manner in the 2d and 5th Years of Queen <i>Eliz.</i> Another
time it hath not been presented till the Vespers
were finished, but in the Practice of latter Days the
Scrutiny hath not been given up to the Sovereign till
the next Day at the opening of the Chapel before Morning-Prayer,
as in the 13, 15, 20, 30 Years of Queen <i>Eliz.</i>
demonstrates, and was the accustomed Practice of the
17th Year of King <i>Charles</i> the first of ever-sacred Memory;
the last presentation was transcribed in a little
Book, and with all due Reverence offered upon the
Knee, before any other Affair was transacted in the
Chapter.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>This</span> has been the general Use as we are ascertain’d,
<i>Anno</i> 2 <i>Hen.</i> VI. the Dean of <i>Windsor</i>, and the Register
of the Order, having Collected the Vote of every
Knight, they were immediately given into the Hands
of the Sovereign’s Deputy; and in the same nature
were they presented on the 4th <i>Hen.</i> VI. when <i>John</i>
Duke of <i>Bedford</i> was Lieutenant, in the 20th of Queen
<i>Eliz.</i>; when the Suffrages were Collected by Sir <i>Francis
Walsingham</i> the Chancellor, he gave them up to the Earl
of <i>Sussex</i>, then Lieutenant to the Sovereign.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>But</span> it’s evident from several Passages in the Blue
Book of the Order, that the Lieutenant afterward delivered
them to the Sovereign, as is apparent from the
Records of the 30th, 34th, 38th, and the 40th Year of
Queen <i>Eliz.</i></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='257' id='Page_257'></span>In the 12th Year of K. <i>James</i> I. some Exceptions arose
upon the Chancellor’s not presenting the Scrutiny to the
Prince, (who at that time was the Sovereign’s Lieutenant)
but to the Sovereign himself, which was an Error
he fell into, as well as some of his Predecessor’s; as the
2d, 3d, and 25th of <i>Eliz.</i> demonstrate.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>The Sovereign’s Considerations upon the Qualifications of those<br /> to be elected.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 12. As the Knights-Companions are under an Obligation,
by the Statutes, to nominate no Person, but who
can bear the Test of the afore-mention’d Qualifications,
there’s a Standard of Honour provided for the Sovereign,
to measure the Extraction, Quality, and Merit of the Person
proposed to be elected, least it might chance, thro’
the Indulgence of the Sovereign, this Fountain of Honour
might be mudded by the Choice of inferior and undeserving
Persons, for the Statutes run—because this <i>Order
consists of Goodness, and honourable Virtue, doth not admit
Unworthiness and Villany</i>, and so by Consequence secludes
all Persons of mean Extraction and Merit.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Qualifications for <i>Election</i> are exhibited in the 2d
Article, as in the 18th are included those of <i>Nomination</i>:
The Words of the <i>Institution</i> are, <i>That none shall be elected
into the Order</i>; and refer only to the Act of Election:
For if we consult the rest of the Statutes, and compare
them with this Passage, they run according to this Tenor,
<i>That none shall be elected and chosen a Companion of
this Order</i>. These refer more principally to the Time of
the Election, and not to the <i>Investiture</i> with <i>Garter</i>, and
<i>George</i>, and <i>Installation</i>, from the Expressions of <i>admitting</i>
and <i>receiving</i> Knights into this <i>Order</i>, as the <i>Examplars</i> of
the <i>Statutes</i> of <i>Institution</i> set forth. And this is farther
illustrated, from another Passage in the 2d Article of <i>Henry</i>
the VIII’s Statutes, where the Word <i>Reproach</i> is mentioned,
saith, <i>The Guilt thereof so incapacitates a Man’s Election,
that for the future it’s a Bar, and utterly disqualifies
him for that Honour</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are Two Points requisite for <i>Qualifications and
Endowments</i>; first, to be a <i>Gentleman of Blood</i>; and, 2dly,
a <i>Knight</i> without <i>Reproach</i>. By the Statutes of <i>Henry</i> the
Vth’s <i>Institutions</i>, no Man ought to be elected, <i>unless he
<span class='pageno' title='258' id='Page_258'></span>be a Gentleman born</i>. The <i>Examplar</i> in the <i>Black Book</i>
saith, <i>Unless he be worthy upon the Account of Birth and
Arms</i>: And in another Passage, <i>That he be one eminent
for his Demeanour and good Report</i>; which intimates the
Conjunction of Blood and Virtue, which make up the
noblest Composition. The Statutes of King <i>Henry</i> VIII.
are more extensive than those, and say, <i>He must be a Gentleman
by Name, Arms, and Blood</i>; and least this Character
might seem intricate and perplex’d, <i>A Gentleman of Blood</i>
is defin’d to be, <i>One descended of three Descents of Nobles</i>,
viz. <i>of Name and Arms, both by his Father and Mother’s
side</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>It’s certain <i>Gentility</i> does not receive its Perfection in
the Person it was first devolv’d on, but is rather compleated
by Succession: For, among the <i>Romans</i>, tho’ the Father
was Free-born, and of the <i>Equestrian Cense</i>; yet it
was farther requisite, that the Grand-father should be the
same, or else they could not obtain the Ring, one of the
<i>Symbols</i> of the <i>Equestrian Order</i>, as <i>Pliny</i> informs us. <i>Gentility</i>
hath its beginning in the Grand-father, its increase
in the Father, and full ripeness in the Son; and consequently
in the Constitution of <i>Gentility</i>, the Father and
Grand-father conveying a Lustre to the Son, make it
entire and compleat; for its incongruous to suppose a
ripeness in the Son, unless there had been a former encrease
in the Father, and a longer Series from the Grand-father.</p>

<p class='c000'>The memorable Instance of the Lord <i>William Paget</i>,
who was divested of the <i>Garter</i> five Years after his Election,
upon Pretence of his not being a Gentleman of
Blood by either Father or Mother, proceeded not wholly
from the defect in Point of Extraction, as <i>Haward</i> relates,
but rather from the Prevalence and Practice of <i>John
Dudley</i>, Duke of <i>Northumberland</i>, by whose means he was
most unjustly deprived of the <i>Garter</i>; repenting, perhaps,
at the great Honours he had done this Lord, by his fair
Character of him to King <i>Edward</i> VI. when he procured
him a new Grant of those Arms, under the Great Seal of
<i>England</i>, when he was <i>Earl Marshal</i>, which he had some
time before received from the Garter Principal King of
Arms.</p>

<p class='c000'>But, admit the defect of <i>Blood</i> and <i>Arms</i>, for three Descents,
were the true Cause of the recalling his <i>Garter</i>,
<span class='pageno' title='259' id='Page_259'></span>that it might be conferred upon the Earl of <i>Warwick</i>, eldest
Son of the said Duke, who, out of courtesie, is called
so, in which Relation both <i>Haward</i> and <i>Stow</i> have mistaken,
for they were bestowed upon Sir <i>Andrew Dudley</i>,
Brother to the Duke; for tho’ he was put in the Scrutiny
enter’d among the <i>Annals</i> of <i>Edward</i> VI. in the Sixth
Year of his Reign, upon St. <i>George</i>’s Day, yet was the
Earl neither then, nor at any other time, elected.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Ensigns of this most Noble Order, as soon as
Queen <i>Mary</i> ascended the Throne, were with as much
Honour restored to the Lord <i>Paget</i>, and with as great and
absolute an Authority, as they were disgracefully taken
from him. And in Confirmation of this Lord’s Restauration,
he had the <i>Garter</i> buckled on his Leg, and the <i>Collar</i>
and the <i>Order</i> put about his Shoulders, with the <i>George</i>
depending, by two of the Knights-Companions present;
and the Garter King at Arms was order’d, That he should
take Care his <i>Atchievements</i> should be replaced over his
<i>Stall</i> at <i>Windsor</i>, which is the 9th on the Sovereign’s side.
It is observable, that the very Records of the Order
brand his Degradation as Injustice; as if it were inferable,
That when Honour is conferred, upon the Account
of Virtue and exquisite Endowments, the Consideration
of these supplies the defect and obscurity of Extraction.
The Sovereign, whose Prerogative it was to declare and
interpret the Statutes, being present in Chapter, thought
fit to qualifie the Law, and gave him this honourable
Commendation, <i>That he had highly deserved of the Nation,
by his Prudence and Counsel</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>And though there’s only inserted in the <i>Examplar</i> of
the <i>Black Book</i>, <i>Virtue</i> and <i>good Report</i> for a Qualification,
yet the same was observed by the Sovereigns and Lieutenants
in foregoing Times, with great Circumspection; and
that the <i>Magnanimity</i>, <i>Fortitude</i>, <i>Prudence</i>, <i>Generosity</i>, <i>Fame</i>,
<i>Reputation</i>, and other Virtues and Excellencies, whether
innate or acquired, of the Person proposed to Election,
have by prudent Inquisition been inspected, and brought
to the Touchstone, before they have been admitted into
so noble and illustrious a Body.</p>

<p class='c000'>Those Qualities were chiefly consider’d and esteemed
by <i>Henry</i> V. for which Reason, at an Election in the
9th Year of his Reign, he gave the Preference, before
others that were nominated and presented unto him, to
<span class='pageno' title='260' id='Page_260'></span><i>John</i>, Earl Marshal, <i>William</i>, Earl of <i>Suffolk</i>, <i>John</i>, Lord
<i>Clifford</i>, Sir <i>Lewis Robertsack</i>, and Sir <i>Heer Tank Clux</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Humphry</i>, Duke of <i>Gloucester</i>, Deputy to K. <i>Hen.</i> VI.
trod in the same Steps, and did weigh, by the strict Rules
of Fortitude and Prudence, the gallant and noble Actions
and Deserts of <i>John</i>, Lord <i>Talbot</i>, before the Election,
and gave in an Approbation worthy of his own Judgment,
and that Candidate’s Merit. And for this Reason it’s expressed
in the <i>Annals</i> of the Order, that such noble and heroick
Qualifications should have the favour of Election
preferrable to others, as is evident in the Matter of Choice
of Sir <i>Nicholas Carew</i>, in the 28th of <i>Hen.</i> VIII. <i>That he
was a very fit Person, upon the Eminency of his Extraction
and Fame, and the many noble and worthy Actions he had
performed; so as that all present did, without any delay,
unanimously approve of his Election</i>. And after this Tenure
run the Commendation of <i>Henry</i>, Earl of <i>Cumberland</i>, at
his Election, <i>viz.</i> <i>The many famous and loyal Atchievements
performed by him, both at several other times, and then
more especially, when the Tumult of Rebellion began to break
forth in those Borders where he had his Habitation</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The 2d Point to treat on is, That no one is qualified
for Election, unless he be a <i>Knight</i>; or as it is expressed
in one of the <i>Examplars</i> in the <i>Hatton Library</i>, <i>Unless
girded with the unstained Girdle of Knighthood</i>; so singular
a regard the Law of the Order hath to this particular Qualification
above the rest: And least Chance or Inadvertency
might let slip a Person not Knighted into the Scrutiny,
were the Words inserted <i>ut minimum</i>, that he be at least
a <i>Knight</i> before he be elected, when the Sovereign comes
to make his Choice. It is evident from the 2d Article
in the Statutes, that it hath long since received this Construction,
as appears by an eminent Instance. In the
17th of <i>Hen.</i> VIII. The Feast of St. <i>George</i> being celebrated
at <i>Greenwich</i>, and the Sovereign being present, having
elected the Lord <i>Roos</i>, afterwards Earl of <i>Rutland</i>,
into the Society of this most noble Order; and being advertised
on the Morrow after St. <i>George</i>’s Day, while the
Mass of <i>Requiem</i> was celebrating, <i>That he had not before
received the Dignity of Knighthood, according to the Statutes</i>,
which positively enjoin, <i>That whosoever is elected into this
Society, should be in Degree at least a Knight</i>; that is, actually
<i>Knighted</i> before-hand. And tho’ the Lord <i>Roos</i> was,
<span class='pageno' title='261' id='Page_261'></span>at the Time of his Election a Baron of this Realm, which
is a higher degree of Honour than a <i>Knight</i>; The Sovereign
after Mass re-assembled the <i>Knights-Companions</i>,
and annulled the Election, and commanded the <i>Garter</i>
and <i>George</i>, so lately conferred, to be taken off, and in the
same Place dubbed him a Knight; and then he was Elected
again, with an unanimous Consent, and so declared
by the Sovereign’s own Mouth; and was restored to his
<i>Ensigns</i> and <i>Ornaments</i>, by the Dukes of <i>Norfolk</i> and <i>Suffolk</i>.
Agreeable to this, it’s recorded in the <i>Red Book</i> of the
Order; that none of the <i>English</i>, <i>Scotch</i>, or <i>Welsh Nation,
how considerable soever otherwise, in the Prerogative of
Blood or Virtue, can be Elected into this most honourable
Society; but that he ought to be first ennobled and rendered
capable, by this first degree of Knightly Honour</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>But this Law does not bind Foreign Princes; for by a
Decree at <i>White-Hall</i>, in 13 <i>Charles</i> I. these Words, <i>ut
minimum</i>, are explained to relate to all Subjects, of what
Degree soever, within the Sovereign’s Dominions; but
Foreign Princes ought not to be <i>Knighted</i>, as the Basis and
first Degree of <i>Chivalry</i>. The <i>Statutes of Institution</i>, as to
those before-mentioned, not only enjoyn them to be
<i>Knights</i>, but to be free of all <i>Infamy and Reproach</i>. In
<i>Henry</i> V’s. Statutes, it stands, <i>Chivalier sans reproche</i>, which
Answers in the Latin, <i>Eques irreprehensus</i>; and the Argument
used by the Duke of <i>Bedford</i>, for promoting the
Election of Sir <i>John Radcliff</i>, was, that he had continued
and exercised the Armies, the space of twenty eight
Years, without <i>Reproach</i>. King <i>Henry</i> VIII. determined
this Word <i>Reproach</i> into three Species; first, <i>when a Knight
hath been convicted of Heresy, against the Catholick Faith</i>;
or <i>suffered any publick Punishment for such Offence</i>: Here
Heresy is reckoned among those defects, that deprive Men
of Honour; because it bends its Force against the Catholick
Church, which not only renders a Man, in the ballance
of <i>Honour</i>, of no <i>Weight</i> and <i>Esteem</i>, but more than
all other Sins, makes him <i>Infamous</i>. And therefore when
by <i>Tongue</i>, <i>Pen</i>, or <i>Actions</i>, a Man endeavours to trample
under Foot the <i>sacred Law</i>, he scandalizeth Government,
and seduceth others.</p>

<p class='c000'>The second Point is, when any Knight hath been <i>arraigned,
convicted, and attainted of Treason</i>; however
Q. <i>Elizabeth</i> qualified this Point by a Decree, made in
<span class='pageno' title='262' id='Page_262'></span>the first Year of her Reign; <i>that in case any Persons so
convicted, were pardoned by the Sovereign, and restored in
Blood; every such Gentleman in Name, Arms, and Blood,
and descended as aforesaid, being otherwise qualified, according
to the ancient Statutes of the Order, should be thenceforth
accounted Eligible, and might be Chosen a Companion</i>.
This Decree, it’s presumed, owes its Original, upon the
occasion of restoring in <i>Blood</i> <i>William</i> Marquiss of <i>Northampton</i>,
and the Lord <i>Robert Dudley</i>, after Earl of <i>Leicester</i>,
who had been attainted of High Treason in the
first of Q. <i>Mary</i>: And we find that in the next Feast of
St. <i>George</i>, they recovered their Privileges of Honour, and
were preferred in <i>Nomination</i>, and on the last Day of the
Feast, were Elected into this most illustrious Society.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though the Marquess of <i>Northampton</i> had been formerly
Elected in the 35 <i>H.</i> 8. and was restored in Blood,
as I said before; it’s very remarkable, that it was thought
fit to descend to a new Nomination and Election, as appears
from the Decree it self, as it was performed upon
the third of <i>June Anno primo Eliz.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>The last Point of Reproach, is, <i>where a Knight Companion
hath fled from Battle</i>; in which the <i>Sovereign</i>, or
his <i>Lieutenant</i>, or other <i>Captain</i>, (having the King’s Authority)
were present; when Banners were displayed,
and both Sides proceed to Fight. Now for a Person to
behave himself cowardly in the Fight, abandon his Colours,
leave his Prince, Friends, and Companions, in
hazard of Life, are undoubtedly Concerns of a very
high and reproachful Nature, and draw down Dishonour
upon the Order, the Sovereign, and Knights Companions,
and a sufficient indication of a pusilanimous Mind; that
prefers to drag an infamous Life, and makes his Honour
a Sacrifice to a reproachful Safety; for the Resolution of
a right <i>Martial Spirit</i>, ought either to return decked with
Victory, or die upon the Bed of Honour.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the Laws of King <i>Edward</i> the Confessor, the <i>Soldier</i>
that runs from his <i>Colours</i>, either in Land or Sea Service,
his <i>Life</i> and <i>Estate</i> were made liable to answer the Offence;
and our Acts of Parliaments have made it <i>Felony</i>,
without <i>Benefit of Clergy</i>; for as much as such desertion
endangers the Estate of the <i>King</i>, <i>Nobility</i>, and <i>Commonwealth</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='263' id='Page_263'></span>But the danger is of a far more dismal hue, when Officers,
or he that Commands in Chief, or who has any
Post of Trust assigned him, either quit it, or is found defective
in his Duty, as was <i>Thomas Earl of Lancaster</i>, who
quitted the Army at the Siege of <i>Berwick</i>, the consequence
of which proved an abortion to the whole Design; and
for which he was proclaimed <i>Traytor</i>, <i>Anno</i> 12 <i>E.</i> 2. And
therefore whoever is culpable of any of these three Points
of <i>Reproach</i>, is disqualified from being Elected into this
most <i>noble Order</i>. Before we proceed any farther, it may
not be improper to take notice of an Error which <i>Polydore
Virgil</i> hath interwove with one, and which <i>Erhardus
Celius</i>, in his History of <i>England</i>, hath copyed from that
Author, but refuted by the learned Pen of Dr. <i>Heylein</i>, <i>viz.</i>
that the <i>Knights-Companions</i> have certain <i>Laws</i> belonging
to their Order, whereby they are <i>obliged to help one
another, and in Time of Battle never to betake themselves
to shameful Flight</i>: The <i>Statute Law</i> of the <i>Order</i> is silent
upon the first Clause, nor is the latter otherwise to be
taken, than one of those Points of Reproach spoke of in
the second <i>Statute of K. Henry</i> VIII. which nulls the <i>Election</i>
of the Person nominated, if he be peccant in that
Point: Now that which gives some Umbrage to the
<i>Knights</i> mutual Assistance and Defence, is founded upon
an Article in their <i>Statutes</i>, which prohibits the arming
themselves one against another, to create a mutual Affection,
and to extinguish Feuds, which is the Life and
Soul of Society, and which the Founder, to prevent Inconveniencies,
had a great Regard to; and therefore he
Ordained, which has been confirmed since by other Statutes;
That none of the Knights-Companions should Arm
themselves against any of their <i>Fellows</i>, unless either in the
Cause of his Sovereign, or his own just Quarrel: And
this Clause it was, that gave the Handle to both Parties,
that sided with the Houses of <i>York</i> and <i>Lancaster</i>; some
firmly adhering to <i>Henry</i> VI. whom they accounted <i>Sovereign</i>
of the Order; and others taking Part with
<i>Edward</i> IV. as esteeming him Sovereign <i>de Jure</i>, though
not <i>de Facto</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>But more firmly to tye this Knot of Amity among
this noble <i>Fraternity</i>, least they should unhappily engage in
Factions one against another, and proceed so violently as
might commence into Actions of Blood and Slaughter;
<span class='pageno' title='264' id='Page_264'></span>it was ordained, That if a Knight-Companion should happen
to be retained in the Service of a Foreign Prince, to
take up Arms in his Quarrel; and after his Adversary
desired to entertain another <i>Knight-Companion</i> on his Side
also; he that was last invited, was bound to wave this
Offer, and in no wise to give his Consent. And upon this,
the <i>Knights-Companions</i> were obliged to make special Precautions
in that their Engagements; that if any of his
Fellows were retained on the other Side, and that if he
knew not that another of his <i>Fellows</i> had been engaged
with the Adversary, so soon as it came to his Knowlege,
he was obliged to relinquish the Service he before
had undertaken.</p>

<p class='c000'>To these three Points of <i>Reproach</i> we have set down,
we find in a Manuscript, that belonged to <i>Heny Grey</i>, third
Marquiss of <i>Suffolk</i>, a fourth added to these other three
<i>Points</i> of <i>Reproach</i>; in these Words:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='goth'>
That if any Knight of the Order, from
henceforth, by Prodigality or Ryot, wilfully
or negligently, Dispend, Sell, Aliens, or do
away his Patrimony or Livelihood, by reason
whereof, he shall not be able honourably
to maintain himself, and his Estate, in
such honourable manner, as may Conserve
the honour of the said Order, and of himself;
in this Case he shall be Summoned
by the Usher of Arms of the Order, called
the black Rod, by Commandment of the
</span>
Soveraign,
<span class='goth'>
his
</span>
Lieutenant,
<span class='goth'>
or
</span>
Deputy;
<span class='goth'>
to appear
before his Majesty, or his Commissioners,
and the Knights of the Order, at the
next
</span>
Chapter
<span class='goth'>
ensuing; there to be examined
before the Soveraign, or his said Commissioners,
and the Knights and Companions
of the said Order; and if he be found in
such great default of
</span>
Prodigality, insolent Riot,
or wilful Negligence;
<span class='goth'>
that then the Soveraign,
with the advice of the Company of
</span>
<span class='pageno' title='265' id='Page_265'></span><span class='goth'>
the said Order may deprive and degrade
him of the said Order, at the said Chapter,
if it be their Pleasure.
</span></p>

<p class='c008'>Though this fourth Point is not inserted into King
<i>Henry</i> VIII’s Statutes, yet the Substance thereof seems to
be approved of before; for we find among some <i>Orders</i>,
prepared by the Marquiss of <i>Exeter</i>, and other Knights-Companions,
at a Chapter at <i>Windsor</i>, the twenty fifth
and twenty sixth Days of <i>May</i>, <i>Anno</i> 8 <i>Henry</i> VIII. one
of them was something to this Purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>§. 13. Amongst the Number of these Candidates, the
Sovereign is chiefly to regard those who have <i>most Voices</i>,
or whom he conceives most requisite to contribute to the
<i>Honour of the Garter</i>, and most Beneficial to himself, and
of most Advantage to his Crown and Kingdom. We
find the Law hath not always reserved the greatest Number
of Voices, as will appear from the Annals; yet it has
sometimes confirmed the Election, as in the Case of the
Duke of <i>Queenberry</i> <i>An.</i> 5 <i>Henry</i> VI. where, after a due and
sufficient Examination taken of the <i>Scrutiny</i>, the Duke, by
the consent of most Voices, was Elected into the Stall of
<i>Thomas</i> Duke of <i>Exeter</i>; and so was the Election of Sir
<i>Nicholas Carew</i>, the twenty fourth of <i>April</i>, in the 28
<i>Henry</i> VIII.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is remarkable in a singular Instance, that when two
Knights had on either Side equal <i>Voices</i>; which was the
Case of Sir <i>John Fastolf</i>, and Sir <i>John Radcliff</i>; the first
being esteemed more Worthy, by the Sovereign’s Lieutenant,
obtained the Election.</p>

<p class='c000'>The second Inducement relates to such as, in all Appearance,
may bring most Renown to the <i>Order</i>, and advance
it to a higher pitch of Greatness; and these have in
a great Measure been effected, by enrolling Foreign
Princes into this <i>illustrious Society</i>, whose Valour and
great Merit have proclaimed them deserving both of
<i>Nomination and Election</i>. And upon this Consideration,
K. <i>Charles</i> I. of blessed Memory, <i>upon Consideration had of
the glorious Atchievements, and high Renown, of</i> Gustavus
Adolphus <i>King of Sweden; judged it a Part of his Respect,
not only to render him all Offices of Kindness and
<span class='pageno' title='266' id='Page_266'></span>Friendship, as to a Prince nearly allied, and his most special
Friend; but also to impart to him, as far as in him lay,
the greatest and highest Honour that might be, and especially
such, wherewith the military Virtue of so great a Captain
was wont to be adorned</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the principal Motive thought requisite to
Elect Foreign Princes into this Society of Honour, hath
been expressed in the <i>Commissions</i> of <i>Legations</i>, <i>to be in
Respect of their glorious Merits, ennobled by the lustre and
grace of their Heroick Virtues, their eminent Nobleness,
Grandeur, Prowess, and Magnificence; the renown of which,
Fame had divulged and spread Abroad throughout the
World</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Where the Advantage of the Sovereign’s Service was
thrown into the Ballance, no Consideration could outvie
its Pretensions, as in 2 <i>H.</i> 6. justifies; whose eminent
Service for his King and Country, was the sole Motive
that crowned his Election: And the great Zeal and Affection,
which <i>John Jaspar Ferdinand de Marchin</i> shewed
for the Cause and Service, and the recovery of the just
Rights of King <i>Charles</i> II. was the strongest Inducement
that swayed that Sovereign to chuse him, in the tenth
Year of his Reign, a Knight-Companion of this most noble
Order. But the last inducement is of the greatest Latitude,
for the <i>Sovereign</i> has a Power to reject whosoever
he pleases, though they do exceed in multiplicity of <i>Voices</i>,
and in other <i>Qualifications</i>; and even to Elect a Person
that’s but once mentioned, as was shewn in the Person of
<i>Casimire</i>, the fourth King of <i>Poland</i>, <i>An.</i> 28 <i>Henry</i> VI. who
having only the single Vote of the Lord <i>Scales</i>; yet upon
respect to the <i>Sovereign</i>, how advantageous he might be
for his, and his Kingdom’s Interest, obtained the Election.</p>

<p class='c000'>And of later Date, (as the Preambles for the carrying
the Ensigns to Foreign Princes set forth) the Advantages
the Sovereign has conceived to possess himself of, in the
improving, confirming, and establishing, of a most strict
and <i>inviolable Bond</i> of Friendship, and fair Correspondence,
between him and Foreign Princes, their Realms and Subjects,
hath been a grand Inducement to Elect such Princes
into this most noble Order.</p>

<p class='c008'>§ 14. Upon the vacancy of any of the <i>Knights-Companions</i>
Stalls, the <i>Election</i> of others to supply those, is a
<span class='pageno' title='267' id='Page_267'></span>Prerogative of the <i>Sovereign</i>, and in some Cases to his Lieutenant;
for it’s recorded in the <i>Black Book of the Order</i>, in
<i>Henry</i> VIII’s Statutes: That <i>if any Stalls fall Vacant, it
should belong to the Sovereign, to Elect new Knights, wheresoever
he was Resident</i>; upon Condition, the Chapter consisted
of six compleat <i>Knights-Companions</i>; but if he chanced
to be out of his Realms, and the Number was deficient,
and that his Lieutenant held the <i>Feast of St. George</i>
at <i>Windsor</i>; in such a Case the <i>Election</i> belongs to the
<i>Lieutenant</i>, who is first to be certified of his <i>Sovereign</i>’s
Pleasure, and what Esteem <i>he</i> has for the Candidates,
to the intent such Information may guide, or direct his
Election.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Power of <i>Election</i> is fully acknowledged, by the
<i>Knights-Companions</i> themselves, to be in the Sovereign;
as the fragment of a Letter demonstrates, sent from <i>the
Chapter</i>, convened at <i>Windsor</i>, upon the <i>Feast of St. George</i>,
to <i>Henry</i> V. then in <i>France</i>; viz. <i>That the Sovereign, in what
Place soever residing, may, as is most fitting, Elect into a
vacant Stall, (there being a sufficient Number of Knights
called to this Election) such as he shall judge serviceable to
his Crown, or do exceed others in deserts, and nobleness of
descent</i>: And at publishing the <i>Election</i> of <i>Duke Emanuel</i>
of <i>Savoy</i>, in the Reign of <i>Philip</i> and <i>Mary</i>, who were <i>joint
Sovereigns</i> of the <i>Order</i>; it’s styled, The Election of the
<i>King and the Queen</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>This grand Prerogative of the <i>Sovereign</i> being not duly
weighed by <i>Polydore Virgil</i>, occasioned his tripping in this
Affair, and drew in <i>Claudius Coteræus</i> into the same palpable
mistake; for writing of this <i>Order</i>, and the Succession
of new Knights, reports in his History of <i>England</i>,
That <i>one Knight is received in the room of another deceased,
by the Choice and Election of all the rest</i>; and <i>Erhard Celly</i>
in his <i>Anglo-Wirtemb.</i> does as falsely affirm, <i>That no Person
may be received into this Order, not so much as by the
Sovereign, unless with the common Consent and Suffrage of
all the Knights-Companions</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>But these Passages are altogether erroneous, the <i>Knights-Companions</i>
only <i>nominate</i> the <i>Persons</i>, but the right of
<i>Election</i> remains solely in the <i>Sovereign</i> of the Order; for
whosoever is honoured with his Choice, is immediately
admitted; and pronouncing barely the Name of the Person
in Chapter, constitutes the Election. After the Scrutiny
<span class='pageno' title='268' id='Page_268'></span>hath been taken, and presented to the Sovereign, he
peruseth it himself, or the <i>Chancellor</i>, or some other Officer
of the <i>Order</i> that gathered it, reads it over to him; afterwards
the Sovereign resolves forthwith, upon some one or
more of the Knights, contained in the Scrutiny; and
then publickly declareth the <i>Name</i> of him, or them, he
does <i>Elect</i>; and by the bare Act of his <i>Pronunciation</i>, they
Commence Elected Knights; except now and then the
Sovereign is pleased to give his Reasons, why the Knight
is Elected by him.</p>

<p class='c000'>But though this Act of <i>Election</i> be solely in the <i>Sovereign</i>,
yet the Consent of the <i>Knights-Companions</i> is frequently
recorded in the <i>Annals</i>, and sometimes mentioned
in the <i>Commissions</i> of <i>Legations</i> to <i>Foreign Princes</i>; not that
the single Act of <i>Election</i> is, in truth, the Act of the whole
Chapter, or is made invalid, without the joynt Consent
of the <i>Knights-Companions</i>, present at the Election; but
their Consent so expressed, is to be taken as an honorary
Respect given them by the Register, intimating rather an
Applause, or Commendation of their <i>Sovereign’s Choice</i>,
as being in their Opinions Just and Right, according to
the Merit of the Elected, than a material Circumstance,
tending to the Ratification of the Election made by the
Sovereign, as if defective without it.</p>

<p class='c008'>§. 15. Among other Duties incumbent on the <i>Register</i>,
and expressed in the Statutes of the <i>Order</i>, this is one:
That the Register’<i>s Office is to set down, and record for a
Memorial, the Elections (or Scrutinies,) and Names of the
Knights Elected</i>: But in succeeding Times a Scruple
arose, if this was not needless, when the <i>Scrutiny</i> should
be taken, yet no <i>Election</i> made; to clear up which doubt,
in a Chapter held in 5 <i>Elizabeth</i>, on St. <i>George</i>’s-<i>Day</i>, it’s
recorded as the Sovereign’s Will and Pleasure, that thenceforward
it should be Enacted, and received as the Sanction
of a <i>Law</i>, within this Order; <i>That if any Nominations
were taken from the Knights-Companions, the same
should be entered into the Annals, though there were no Election
made of any Person into the Order at that Time</i>:
Which we presume was so Decreed, out of great deference
to those Princes and noble Personages, who, in descending
Times, should, by the glory of their Exploits,
appear but worthy of a <i>bare Nomination</i> into so resplendent
<span class='pageno' title='269' id='Page_269'></span>and illustrious an Order. And in pursuance of this
<i>Decree</i>, there is frequent mention made of the delivery
of the <i>Scrutiny</i> into the Hands of the Register, in order
to be Recorded.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Blue Book says, <i>Anno</i> 22 <i>Elizabeth</i>; <i>That the
Chancellor himself</i> delivered the <i>Knights-Companions Votes
to the Register, to be committed to Writing, for a perpetual
Memorial; and accordingly the Register, as his Duty obliged
him, transcribed them, and put them in their proper Place,
with all Care and Fidelity</i>. <i>Anno</i> 34 of the same Queen,
’tis said, <i>the Votes were delivered to the Register, who took
care to Record them, according to usual Order</i>. Yet maugre
this Law, the Entry of Scrutinies hath been sometimes
omitted, either by the <i>Register</i>’s forgetfulness of the
Decree, or some accidental Miscarriages. In some Places
of the Annals, in the room of <i>Scrutinies</i>, we find Excuses
entered, as it’s said, <i>Anno</i> 28 <i>Elizabeth</i>; that the
<i>Prelate</i>, immediately after <i>Vespers</i>, presented the Scrutiny
to the Sovereign; but because there was no Election made
of any new <i>Knights</i>, in regard of hurry, or weighty and
pressing Affairs, it was laid aside, and <i>through Neglect
lost</i>, or at least came not into the <i>Register</i>’s Hands, to be
inserted in its proper Place. And when the Dean of <i>Windsor</i>
collected the Scrutiny at <i>Vespers</i>, <i>Anno</i> 18 <i>Elizabeth</i>,
it’s said, <i>No Election was made, nor any thing else done</i>:
The like Excuse is made, <i>Anno</i> 5 <i>Charles</i> I. but the Fault
is thrown upon the Chancellor; for though the Scrutiny
had been taken by him, during the <i>Vespers of the Feast-Day,
yet would he not suffer it to be entered</i>. In some Places
we find, <i>Anno</i> 31 <i>Elizabeth</i>, the <i>Votes</i> being presented,
<i>they were left with her</i>. And <i>Anno</i> 11 <i>Charles</i> I. the Scrutiny
of <i>Algernoon</i> Earl of <i>Northumberland</i> never came to
the Register’s Hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the Law yet remains in force, that all <i>Nominations</i>
and <i>Votes</i> of the <i>Knights-Companions</i> ought to be enter’d
among the <i>Annals</i>, whether Election be made or not, unless
it shall please the <i>Sovereign</i>, upon some Emergency, to
forbid it: As appears but by one Example of such a Prohibition,
<i>viz.</i> <i>Anno</i> 40 <i>Eliz.</i> where, by the Queen’s special
Command, the <i>Scrutiny then taken was not recorded
among the Acts of this most Noble Order</i>. But then it is declared,
That <i>the Register took care to set down all the Passages
as they happened, the Names only excepted</i>. And
<span class='pageno' title='270' id='Page_270'></span>why the <i>Scrutiny</i> is not inserted in the <i>Registry</i>, <i>An.</i> 44 of
<i>Eliz.</i> gives this Account: That upon assembling the
<i>Knights-Companions</i>, it seemed good to the Sovereign, for
several urgent Reasons, best known to her self, to give
Commandment, That for that time, <i>they would wholly
forbear all Scrutiny of Votes, and Nominations of Persons</i>;
except which, there was nothing wanting to heighten the
Solemnity of that Assembly: But this in the <i>Annals</i> is said
to be <i>præter morem</i>, contrary to the usual Custom.</p>

<p class='c008'>§ 16. <i>Anno</i> 27 of <i>Eliz.</i> there is a remarkable Occurrence,
not to be passed over; for the Earls of <i>Rutland</i> and
<i>Derby</i>, the morrow after St. <i>George</i>’s Day, were desirous
to have seen the <i>Scrutiny</i>, which was committed into the
Custody of the Dean of <i>Windsor</i>, to be registred, in pursuance
of the before-mentioned Decree, <i>Anno</i> 5 <i>Eliz.</i> but
he returned a modest denial, and said, <i>It ought not to be
seen before it was register’d</i>. The Earls, not satisfied with
this Answer, requested the Opinions of the <i>Knights-Companions</i>,
present at the Feast, on this Affair; who, upon
mature Deliberation, adjudged the Point against them;
and since it has been a standing Rule, that no Knight-Companion
ought to see whom the other hath named.</p>

<p class='c008'>§ 17. It hath chanced, that tho’ the <i>Nominations</i> for <i>Election</i>
have been received, presented and perused, yet the
Sovereign hath thought expedient to defer it, upon several
Considerations, and principally where an intent was to
keep an open Stall; but we must understand this of such
<i>Scrutinies</i> as are taken of Course, at the <i>Vespers</i> on the
Feast-day.</p>

<p class='c000'>And the most memorable Example of this Kind, is that
of the Emperor <i>Sigismond</i>, who expired in the 16th Year
of K. <i>Henry</i> VI. whose Stall was reserved Twenty One
Years, and then determined, that Prince <i>Edward</i>, the Sovereign’s
only Son, should fill it up, being at that time
about Six Years of Age. This is the first Emperor, whose
Election we find register’d in the <i>Annals</i>, being about the
7th of <i>May</i>, in the 4th Year of <i>Henry</i> V. styled <i>Sigismundus
Imperator Almanicus</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>And keeping a vacant Stall was sometimes given as a
Reason by the Sovereign for his deferring an Election, as
is plain from <i>An.</i> 13. <i>Car.</i> I. when the Scrutiny taken
<span class='pageno' title='271' id='Page_271'></span>the Day before was read over in the Chapter-House, the
Sovereign declared, <i>That he would receive no Man into the
Order before his Son</i> Charles. Whereupon all the Knights-Companions
gave their Opinions, <i>That this Resolution was
rather the effect of Justice, than Fatherly Indulgence; since
they all acknowledged him, to be more a Prince by Merit,
and towardliness of his Youth, than by the Fortune of his
Birth</i>. At which the Sovereign expressed his Satisfaction
no otherwise than by Silence.</p>

<p class='c000'>And in like manner, <i>Anno</i> 15 <i>Charles</i> I. when the Chancellor
of the Order gave up the Scrutiny to the Sovereign,
he declared——<i>That he had a purpose to have Chosen
Prince</i> Rupert, <i>his Nephew, a Knight of the Order; but
being then a Prisoner with the Emperor, he would not Elect
any at that Time</i>; whereupon, a vacancy of a <i>Stall</i> was
reserved. It has sometimes been the Sovereign’s Pleasure
to defer Elections, without expressing the Cause, as in
the 13 of <i>Elizabeth</i>; though she perused the Scrutiny in
Chapter, yet the <i>Blue Book</i> informs us; That the <i>said Sovereign
made no Election, though two Stalls were vacant</i>.
Thus was it in the 2, 3, 11, and 12, of K. <i>James</i> I. where
no other mention is made than this; <i>none were admitted
into the Order this Year</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sometimes we find these <i>Prorogations of Elections</i> recorded,
as solely done by the Will of the <i>Sovereign</i>; and
at other Times by the <i>Sovereign</i>, and the approbation of
the <i>Knights-Companions</i>; to the first of these we find a
Memorial, in the 22 of <i>Elizabeth</i>, on the 24 of <i>April</i>;
that the <i>Knights-Companions</i> had a Message sent to their
Chapter, held before Morning-Prayer; <i>That it was the
Pleasure of the Sovereign to prorogue the Election to the following
Year</i>. And so it was, in the 10th of <i>Charles</i> I. though
the Nomination was taken by the Chancellor, and presented
to the Sovereign in Chapter, <i>the Sovereign did not
think fit to make any Election at all</i>. And for a Testimony
of the second, we meet with this Instance, in the
27th of <i>Elizabeth</i>; <i>that with the concurrent Approbation
and Assent of all the Knights-Companions then assisting,
the Sovereign thought fit to put off the Election to another
Time</i>. As to the seeming difference of the <i>Sovereign’s absolute
Authority</i>, and yet the <i>Knights-Companions Approbation</i>,
we have cleared up that Point in the <i>Act of Election</i>;
for though it is <i>his</i> unquestionable Authority and
<span class='pageno' title='272' id='Page_272'></span>Prerogative, to Prorogue <i>Elections ad libitum</i>, yet out of
Respect, and Honour to the <i>Knights-Companions</i>, their
Approbation hath been sometimes exprest.</p>

<p class='c008'>§ 18. When any Knight-Companion hath received a
Summons, to appear at a Chapter of Election, and doth
wilfully refuse, or withdraw himself, he was to be mulct
a Mark for his Disobedience, which King <i>Henry</i> VIII’s
Statutes inlarged to twenty Shillings, payable to the Dean
and College of <i>Windsor</i>, to pray for defunct Souls. And
at his next appearance in Chapter, he was to remain
kneeling in the midst of them, before the Sovereign, or
Deputy, till he was restor’d to their Favour: Yet upon a
just Cause signified to the <i>Sovereign</i> some time before,
under the Seal of his Arms, he was excused, if it was
found just and feasible; if not, it was rejected, and he remained
Punishable.</p>

<p class='c000'>And for greater Caution, this Clause was formerly inserted,
in the <i>Letters of Summons</i>; where, after the Time
and Place for Election was certified, and command given
to observe both, the Letter concludes thus, <i>et se estre ny
poues nous Signifies soubz, &amp;c.</i> and if it cannot be accomplished,
that is, if the Knight-Companion could not meet
at the time assigned, to perform what the Statutes oblige,
he should then <i>signify to the Sovereign, under his Seal, the
cause of his Impediment; so that he might perceive by his
Excuse</i>, whether it was worthy of Acceptance, or he in
Fault or not.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch10' class='c005'>CAP. X.<br /> <br /><i>The</i> Investiture of a Knight-Subject <i>with the</i> Garter and George.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_6 c007'>IF the Knight chance to be at <i>Windsor</i>, that is newly
Elected, or wheresoever the Chapter is held, after
the Sovereign hath signified his Pleasure in the Election
of the Person, the <i>Garter</i> is immediately dispatched
out of the Chapter, to give him the Intelligence; as is apparent
<span class='pageno' title='273' id='Page_273'></span>upon the Choice of the Lord <i>Howard</i>, and Sir <i>Henry
Marney</i>, <i>Anno</i> 2 <i>Henry</i> VIII. who was dispatched from
the Chapter, to conduct them to the <i>Sovereign’s</i> Presence,
to be invested with the principal Ensigns of the Order,
the <i>Garter</i> and <i>George</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>And as <i>Garter</i> hath been accustomed to signify in Person
the <i>Election</i> of a <i>Knight</i>, in like manner an Election
is <i>signified</i>, by the Letters of the <i>Sovereign</i>, when he is
pleased (for the greater Honour of the Person) to weave
by verbal Notice: In such Cases, it’s the <i>Chancellor’s</i> Office
to draw up the <i>Letters</i>, and they are to pass, both
under the <i>Sovereign’s Sign Manual</i>, and Signet of the Order.
Such a particular mark of Distinction and Honour
was conferr’d on our Sovereign of <i>Blessed Memory</i>, <i>King
Charles</i> II. Sir <i>John Burrough Garter</i>, carrying the Letter.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Charles Rex</i>,</p>

<p class='c000'>“Our most dear and entirely beloved Son, having, to
our great Comfort, seen and considered the ripeness of
your Youth, and conceived joyful and pregnant Hopes
of your manly Virtue, in which we are assured you
will increase, to your own Honour, both in Prowess,
Wisdom, Justice, and all Princely Endowments; and
that the Emulation of Chevalry will, in your tender
Years, provoke and encourage you, to pursue the Glory
of Heroick Actions, befitting your Royal Birth, and our
Care and Education. We with the Companions of our
most Noble Order of the Garter, assembled in Chapter,
holden this present Day, at our Castle of <i>Windsor</i>;
have Elected and Chosen you one of the Companions
of our Order. In Signification whereof, we have sent
unto you, by our Trusty and Well-Beloved Servant,
Sir <i>John Burrough</i> Knight-Garter, and our principal
King of Arms, these our <i>Royal Letters</i>, requiring you
to make your speedy repair unto us, to receive the Ensigns
of our most Noble Order, and to be ready for
your Installation, upon the 21st Day of this present
Month. Given under the Signet of our Order, at our
Castle of <i>Windsor</i>, the 20th of <i>May</i>, in the 14th Year <a id='of' name='of'></a>of
our Reign, 1638.”</p>

<p class='c015'><i>To our dearly beloved Son Prince</i> Charles.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' title='274' id='Page_274'></span>This is the only Instance we have met with, where a
Letter was sent to an Elect Knight, and he at the same
time present at Court; but when an Election is confirmed,
and the Person remote from the Court, then the general
Tenure of the Letter is, both to signify his Election,
and Summon him to his Investure, with the Garter and
George, as was performed by the Earl of <i>Derby,</i> and Sir
<i>Edward Strafford</i>, to King <i>Henry</i> of <i>France</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>But where the Sovereign is pleased to mention particular
Services, to recommend the Election of a Knight, the
Preamble of the Letter is worded accordingly; and as
this is a Case not very frequent, it will not be amiss to
exemplify it in the Choice of Sir <i>John Falstoff</i>, where the
Letter runs thus—<i>We considering the virtuous Fidelity you
have shown, and the honourable Exploits you have done, in the
Service of our thrice renowned Father, and that in our Service
also, you (as many others) have given Proof of that
Honour, and these Deserts, wherewith God hath endowed you,
always suffering, as is the part of a good Subject, the Pains
and Toils of War, for the vindicating and maintaining of
our just Right, Claim, and Title, have Chosen you one of our
Companions of our Order.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>When the Letter barely signifies Election, that is, when
the Sovereign does not design a present investure with the
Garter and George, but defers it till he takes Possession of
his Stall, the Day of his Installation is inferred towards the
end of the Letter; and upon his appearance at <i>Windsor</i>,
so soon as he appears in the Chapter-House, the Garter is
first buckled about his left Leg, then follows his Investure
with the rest of the Ornaments of the Order, and lastly
his Installation. And this was the Case of <i>Henry</i> Earl of
<i>Northumberland</i>, <i>Anno</i> 29 <i>Henry</i> VIII. whose Investure of
the Garter was deferr’d till his appearance at <i>Windsor</i>,
and then the whole Ceremony was performed at once.</p>

<p class='c008'>§ 2. If the elect Knight be at hand, where the Chapter
is convened, and the Garter hath been sent to make
known to him the Honour, and Conduct him into the
<i>Chapter-House</i>, to receive the Garter and George, before
they break up, Intimation being given of his approach,
the Sovereign sends out two of the Knights-Companions
to meet him, who, after a mutual Salute, Conduct him
between them, to the Presence of the Sovereign, Garter
<span class='pageno' title='275' id='Page_275'></span>going before them. Thus was <i>Ubrick</i> Duke of <i>Holstein</i>,
<i>Anno</i> 3 <i>Jac.</i> I. introduced into the Chapter, between
Prince <i>Henry</i>, and the Earl of <i>Dorset</i>, and <i>Christian</i> Duke
of <i>Brunswick</i> <i>Anno</i> 22 <i>Jac.</i> I. between <i>William</i> Earl
of <i>Pembrook</i> and <i>Philip</i> Earl of <i>Montgomery</i>, to receive
the Garter and George. The 6th of <i>November</i>, <i>Anno</i> 14
<i>Charles</i> II. <i>Christian</i> Prince of <i>Denmark</i> being elected at
a Chapter held at <i>White-Hall</i>, and then absent, the Garter
King was dispatched next Day by the Sovereign, to inform
him, and to desire his Presence the next Day, that
he might receive his Investure; which accordingly was
done, being conducted between the Earls of <i>Lindsey</i>
and <i>Manchester</i> into the Chapter, Garter preceding them,
and after three Obeysances, they brought him up to the
Sovereign. Among Knights-Subjects, we find the Lord
<i>Burley</i>, and the Lord <i>Grey</i>, were conducted to the Sovereign
by the Lord <i>Clynton</i>, and the Earl of <i>Bedford</i>,
<i>Anno</i> 14 <i>Elizabeth</i>, <i>cum multis aliis</i>. <i>Anno</i> 4 <i>Jac.</i> I.
<i>Robert</i> Earl of <i>Salisbury</i> proceeded up to the Sovereign’s
Throne, between the Earls of <i>Nottingham</i> and <i>Dorset</i>. In
the Reign of King <i>Charles</i> I. the Earl of <i>Northampton</i> was
conducted to receive the Garter in the <i>Chapter-House</i> at
<i>Windsor</i>, between the Earls of <i>Pembrook</i> and <i>Montgomery</i>.
And when King <i>Charles</i> II. appeared, upon his Letter of
Summons, at the Chapter held in the withdrawing Chamber
in <i>Windsor Castle</i>, to receive his Investure, two of the
Senior Knights, <i>viz.</i> <i>Philip</i> Earl of <i>Pembrook</i> and <i>Montgomery</i>,
and <i>Thomas</i> Earl of <i>Arundel</i> and <i>Surry</i>, were sent
out to Conduct him in, who brought him between them
unto the Sovereign, the Gentleman Usher of the Black
Rod going before.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Duke of <i>Monmouth</i> being elected at a Chapter held
in the withdrawing Room at <i>White-Hall</i>, the 28th of
<i>March</i>, <i>Anno</i> 15 <i>Charles</i> II. Garter was immediately sent
to him in the Sovereign’s Bed-Chamber, who being met at
the Door by the Earls of <i>Lindsey</i> and <i>Manchester</i>, both
the Garter and the Black Rod passed to the lower End
of the Room before the Duke and the two Knights-Companions,
whence they proceeded up to the Sovereign
with three Reverences. At the Election of <i>James</i> Duke
of <i>Cambridge</i>, in the same Room at <i>White-Hall</i>, (<i>December</i>
3. <i>Anno</i> 18 <i>Charles</i> II.) Garter was also sent forth into
the Bed-Chamber, to acquaint him that the Earl of
<span class='pageno' title='276' id='Page_276'></span><i>Manchester</i>, and the Duke of <i>Monmouth</i>, were appointed
by the Sovereign and Chapter to bring him in thither;
that done, the aforesaid Knights-Companions arose and
went to the Duke, whom meeting at the Bed-Chamber
Door, they took their compass about the rest of the Knights-Companions,
(then standing) and brought him between
them, from the lower End of the Room, close before the
Sovereign, the Garter and Black Rod proceeding.</p>

<p class='c008'>§ 3. The Knight elect being thus introduced to the Sovereign,
bows with all Reverence, and formerly a short
gratulatory Speech was the vogue, that set forth his acknowledgment
of his Sovereign’s Royal Favour, and the
grateful Respect he bore to the Knights-Companions for
his Election.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Anno</i> 28. <i>Hen.</i> VIII. we find Sir <i>Nicholas Crew</i>, after
he had been conducted into the Chapter-House at <i>Windsor</i>,
to receive his Investiture, thus to address himself:
giving <i>infinite Thanks both to the Sovereign and whole Society,
for that they had vouchsafed to receive him into the Honour
of this most illustrious Order, being a Person in his own
Esteem most unworthy thereof</i>: In the next Place professed,
<i>That whereas he was preferred in this Choice before many
others, much more deserving than himself, it was not to be
attributed to his Merits, or any Thing by him performed, but
meerly to the Sovereign’s Bounty, and the Favour of the
Knights-Companions towards him</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The conferring of so singular an Honour, being thus
thankfully own’d, the Ceremony of Investiture begins;
the <i>Garter</i> first takes place, as the most ancient and chiefest
<i>Ensign</i>, and then the <i>George</i>; but the compleat Investiture
is not performed until the Elect Knights are installed
at <i>Windsor</i>. Formerly the manner of robing of them was
performed on this wise: First, the Elect Knight set his
Foot upon a Stool, and then one of the Knights-Companions,
by the Sovereign’s appointment, as his Substitute,
buckled the enobled Garter about his left Leg, as may be
seen in the <i>Antiquities of</i> Warwickshire, in an old Draught
of the Combats of Sir <i>John Astley</i>, who was inrolled in
this illustrious Body, and is so represented. But of later
Date, the Elect Knight kneeled on his right Knee, whilst
this Ceremony was performed, in which space the Words
of <i>Admonition</i> and <i>Signification</i>, at this part of the Investiture,
<span class='pageno' title='277' id='Page_277'></span>were read. The <i>Admonition</i>, upon the buckling
of the Garter, in the <i>English</i> Statutes of K. <i>Hen.</i> VIII. is
set down on this manner:</p>

<p class='c016'><i>SIR,</i></p>

<p class='c000'><i>The loving Brethren of the Order of the Garter, have received
you their Brother and Fellow; and in Token of this,
they give and present you this present Garter, which God grant
that you receive and wear from henceforth to his Praise and
Glory, and to the Exaltation and Honour of the said Noble
Order, and your self.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Afterwards it was decreed, at a Chapter held at <i>Windsor</i>,
the 5th of <i>August</i>, <i>Anno</i> 1 <i>&amp;</i> 2 <i>Phil.</i> and <i>Mary</i>, to this
effect: ‘That not only the same Advertisements, which
were wont to be given to Strangers at their Investitures,
should be likewise given to Knights-Subjects, that for
the future should be elected and install’d; and with a
farther Proviso, ‘That among the Knights-Companions
there should not be any difference either in Ceremony or
Habit.’</p>

<p class='c000'>Hereupon the aforesaid Tenure ceased to be used upon
the fixing of the Garter, and one Form remained at the
Investiture of Strangers and Knights-Subjects, which is
pronounced by the Chancellor, if the Sovereign or his
Lieutenant be present, otherwise by the Register.</p>

<p class='c008'>“To the Laud and Honour of Almighty God, his immaculate
Mother, and St. <i>George</i> the holy Martyr, tye
or gird your Leg with this noble Garter, wearing it to
the increase of your Honour, and in Token and Remembrance
of this most noble Order; remembring
that thereby you being admonished and encouraged, in
all just Battels and Wars, which only you shall take in
Hand, both strongly to fight, valiantly to stand, and
honourably to have Victory.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But against the Investiture of K. <i>Charles</i> II. the Words
of the Signification being better weighed and considered,
were thus methodized:</p>

<p class='c008'>“To the Honour of God Omnipotent, and in Memorial
of the blessed Martyr St. <i>George</i>, tye about thy Leg,
<span class='pageno' title='278' id='Page_278'></span>for thy Renown, this noble Garter; wear it as the Symbol
of the most illustrious Order, never to be forgotten
or laid aside; that thereby thou may’st be admonished
to be couragious; and having undertaken a just War,
into which only thou shalt be engaged, thou may’st
stand Firm, valiantly Fight, and successfully Conquer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Princely Garter being thus buckled on, and the
Words of the Signification pronounced, the Elect Knight
is brought before the Sovereign, who puts about his Neck
the <i>George</i>, pendant at a Sky-colour’d Ribband, at which
part of the Ceremony, the Admonition used at the adorning
of an installed Knight with the Collar of the Order,
(only changing the Word Collar for Ribband) is pronounced;
but were alter’d upon the Occasion assign’d
before.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wear this Ribband about thy Neck, adorn’d with
the Image of the blessed Martyr, and Soldier of Christ,
St. <i>George</i>; by whose Imitation provok’d, thou may’st
so overpass both prosperous and adverse Adventures,
that having stoutly vanquished thy Enemies, both of
Body and Soul, thou may’st not only receive the Praise
of this transient Combat, but be crown’d with the Palm
of eternal Victory.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Greater Respect is conferr’d upon foreign Princes, who
receive their Election here, than abroad; because the Sovereign
most usually performs the Investiture himself; as
was solemniz’d upon <i>Philip</i>, King of <i>Castile</i>, when the
Sovereign took the Garter from the King at Arms, and
fixed it on his Leg, and Prince <i>Henry</i> fasten’d the Buckle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Queen <i>Elizabeth</i> her self buckled the Garter about the
Leg of <i>John Casimier</i>, Count Palatine of the <i>Rhine</i>, and
hung about his Neck a Gold Chain with the <i>George</i> at it.
And the like Honour did King <i>James</i> I. confer upon the
Duke of <i>Holstein</i>, in the 3d Year of his Reign.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sometimes it happens, tho’ very rarely, for the Sovereign,
out of his special Grace and Favour, to condescend
to Honour a Knight-Subject this way; tho’, when Queen
<i>Elizabeth</i> was pleased to adorn the Lord <i>Burleigh</i> with
the Garter, the <i>Annals</i> record it to be done as it were <i>by
the by</i>. The same Favours she bestow’d, tho’ at different
<span class='pageno' title='279' id='Page_279'></span>times, upon <i>Henry</i>, Earl of <i>Sussex</i>, and the Earl of <i>Shrewsbury</i>.
King <i>James</i> I. invested <i>Henry</i>, Earl of <i>Northampton</i>,
with the principal Ensigns of the Order, as a Person
worthy of so great an Honour: And the <i>Blessed Martyr</i>
placed both the <i>Garter</i> and the <i>George</i>, with his own
Hands, upon King <i>Charles</i> II.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sometimes the Sovereign hath but performed part of
the Investiture, and laid his Commands on the senior
Knight to do the rest. Thus, <i>Anno</i> 13 <i>Henry</i> VIII. the
Sovereign reached out the Garter to the Marquis of <i>Dorset</i>,
and commanded him to buckle it about the Leg of
the Earl of <i>Devonshire</i>; which, whilst he was about, the
Duke of <i>Norfolk</i> gave him his Assistance, and the Sovereign
put on the Gold Chain. At the Investiture of <i>Christian</i>,
Duke of <i>Brunswick</i>, <i>Anno</i> 22 <i>Jac.</i> I. the Sovereign
put about his Neck the Blue Ribband, whereat hung the
Effigies of St. <i>George</i>; and the Earls, who introduc’d him
to the Sovereign’s Presence, buckled on the Garter. Thus
did the Sovereign to <i>William</i>, Earl of <i>Northampton</i>, <i>Anno</i>
4 <i>Car.</i> I. and the Earl of <i>Pembroke</i> fasten’d the Garter
about his left Leg.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Order of Investiture began to be inverted <i>Anno</i>
22 <i>Jac.</i> I. the <i>George</i> and the Ribband being first put on,
and the Garter last. And so was it performed when the
Prince of <i>Denmark</i>, Dukes of <i>Monmouth</i>, <i>Cambridge</i>, and
<i>Albemarle</i>, received their Investiture in the Reign of King
<i>Charles</i> II. The Garter, as it was the first, so is the principal
and most worthy Ensign of the Order; and, in the
Practice of all former Times, had always the Preference
given to it. The Investiture with these two Ensigns,
hath generally been performed by the two senior Knights,
at the Command of the Sovereign; but always in his
Presence, the Chapter sitting; but if absent, then by his
Lieutenant. For, in 31 <i>Eliz.</i> the Lord <i>Buckhurst</i> being
elected at <i>Whitehall</i>, and coming to Court wholly ignorant
of the Affair, and after the Sovereign was risen, (yet
leaving the Chapter sitting) her Lieutenant invested him
both with the <i>Garter</i> and <i>George</i>. After the Solemnity is
compleated, the elect Knight renders most humble Thanks
to the Sovereign, and with due Respects salutes the
Knights-Companions, who re-salute the elect Knight,
and joyfully receive him into their Society. If two or
more elect Knights receive this Investiture at one time,
<span class='pageno' title='280' id='Page_280'></span>as soon as the Senior is invested, and his humble Thanks
presented, he moves downwards towards the Chapter-House
Door, and there stands till the next Junior Knight
is invested; and if there be more, so on until the Chapter
break up.</p>

<p class='c008'>§ 4. Where a Knight-Subject, at the time of his Election,
is far distant from Court, or beyond Sea, and the
Sovereign determines to send him the Two principal Ensigns
of the Order, the Charge of this Employ does of
right belong to the <i>Garter</i>. For the Proof of which there
are divers Precedents.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Letters heretofore sent from the Sovereign, along
with the Ensigns of the Order, to the elect Knights, have,
for the most part, been drawn after the Form of those that
certify the Election, and differs only in the last Clause,
which requires the elect Knight to repair to the Sovereign:
The difference lay not in the Body, but in the
Direction of the Letter, which was always worded according
to the Quality of the Person to whom it was sent.
As to a Knight-Batchelor, the Direction was, <i>To our trusty
and well-beloved</i>; and to an Earl, <i>Right trusty, and right
well-beloved Cousin</i>; to a Duke, <i>Right trusty, and right entirely
beloved Cousin</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Forms of those Letters, sent upon like Occasions to
Knights-Subjects, when King <i>Charles</i> II. was beyond Sea,
were penn’d after another Model, and contained other
additional particular Clauses; as, 1. Power to wear the
<i>Star</i> of Silver about St. <i>George</i>’s Cross; 2. The Great
Collar of the Order; and, 3. To style themselves <i>Knights,
and Companions of the Order of the Garter</i>, in as ample a
Manner, as if they had been installed at <i>Windsor</i>; with
an Assurance of receiving the whole Habit there, when
the Sovereign was restored to the Possession thereof.</p>

<p class='c000'>And it appears from some of these Letters, that by reason
Sir <i>Edward Walker</i>, Garter, was otherwise employ’d
in the Service of the Sovereign, when they were transmitted,
the Sovereign pitch’d upon other Persons, to carry
both the Letters and Ensigns of the Order, and yet
continued the Garter in the Rights of his Office. However,
Sir <i>Edward</i> esteeming this devolving his Employment
on others, as an Invasion on the Rights of his Office;
and having a just regard for the Interest of his Successors,
<span class='pageno' title='281' id='Page_281'></span>no less than his own, humbly petitioned King <i>Charles</i> II.
for Redress, and obtained his gracious Reference thereupon,
to several <i>Knights</i> of the Order, to examine the
Matter, and to give in their Report, what they found, and
what they thought proper to be effected therein; and upon
whose Report the Sovereign did him full Right by his
gracious <i>Declaration</i>. For the Dukes of <i>Buckingham</i> and
<i>Hamilton</i>, and the Marquis of <i>Newcastle</i>, to whom this
Affair was referr’d, gave in their Report to the <i>King</i> at
<i>Breda</i>, <i>May</i> 27. 1650.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>We</i>, George, <i>Duke of</i> Buckingham, William, <i>Duke of</i>
Hamilton, <i>and</i> William, <i>Marquis of</i> Newcastle, <i>Knights
of the most noble Order of the Garter, having read and consider’d
the within written Petition, do find the Allegations
therein mentioned to agree with the Statutes and ancient
Practices of the said Order; and that Garter King of Arms,
and his Deputies, ought to bear all Letters-Patents appertaining
to the Brethren of the said Order, and all Elections
to the Knights elect. And we do therefore make this Report
to your Majesty, to the end you may be pleased to mantain
the Petitioner in his just Rights; and that no Example lately
made may be brought in Precedent against him, or his Successors
in the said Office.</i></p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was formerly the Practice, to send the Book of Statutes,
under the common Seal of the Order, together with
the Letters signifying an Election, and the Ensigns of the
Order, no less to a Knight Subject than to a Stranger,
that he might peruse and advise thereupon, whether he
would accept of the Election, or not; for so it appears,
<i>Anno</i> 4 <i>Hen.</i> VI. by the Letters sent to Sir <i>John Falstoff</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Within a few Days after Prince <i>Rupert</i> was elected into
this Order, (being then in <i>Holland</i>) a Commission of Legation
was prepared to be sent thither, with the <i>Garter</i>
and <i>George</i>, by Sir <i>John Burrough</i>, Kt. to perform the Investiture
with them; but Sir <i>John</i> dying, prevented the
Ceremony. Some time after the Prince had been in <i>England</i>,
the then Sovereign thought fit to lay his Commands
on Sir <i>James Palmer</i>, Chancellor of the Order, to attend
<span class='pageno' title='282' id='Page_282'></span>his Highness, to declare the Reason why the said Commission
was not sent and executed, as was designed, as
well as to deliver him the Commission it self; to the intent
(being prevented of receiving his Installation at
<i>Windsor</i>, because that Castle continued in the Possession
of the Rebels) it might remain with him as a Memorial
of his Sovereign’s Princely Favour, and Respect to his
Quality and Merits, and for a farther Evidence of his being
admitted into this most Noble Order, since there was
no other Memorial thereof, but the Minutes of his Election,
and this Commission. And accordingly on <i>Monday</i>,
the 14th of <i>January</i>, 1644. the Chancellor, accompanied
with Dr. <i>Christopher Wren</i>, Register, and Sir <i>Edward
Walker</i>, newly made Garter, attended the Prince at
his Lodgings in <i>Oxford</i>; who, having notice of their Design,
receiv’d them with all obliging Civility; and the
Chancellor, in an eloquent Speech, made known to his
Highness his Sovereign’s Commands, and the Intent of
his coming; which was no sooner finished, but Sir <i>James
Palmer</i> presented his Petition to the Prince, who gave his
Majesty many humble Thanks for this gracious Message;
and acknowledged his Majesty’s Favours beyond his Desert;
but promised he would study to be more worthy
by his Actions, than in return of Words; with many
Thanks to the Chancellor, and other Officers of the Order,
for their Trouble: Whereupon they took their Leave,
and the Chancellor went immediately to his Majesty, and
gave him a Narrative of what they had done.</p>

<p class='c008'>§ V. It was an ancient Custom, and part of the Ceremony
belonging to the Investiture with the Garter, to
give him an Oath, whether he was a Stranger or a Subject-Knight,
which we find styled, <i>The Oath in such Cases
accustomed to be taken</i>; and which was to this effect; <i>That
the Knight should well and faithfully keep and observe, so
far as God should enable him, all that was contained in the
Statutes of the Order</i>: But this of late hath been disused,
and not imposed, unless upon foreign Princes.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is observable, that <i>Anno</i> 4 <i>Hen.</i> VI. a particular
Commission was issued, to the Earls of <i>Warwick</i>, <i>Salisbury</i>,
and <i>Suffolk</i>, with Power, to any Two, or One of
them, to receive this Oath from Sir <i>John Falstoff</i>, upon
his Investiture; which was besides the Oath his Proctor
<span class='pageno' title='283' id='Page_283'></span>was afterwards to take at the Installation, which Sir <i>John</i>
empowered him to do on his behalf; which was, <i>Such
Oath as should be required at the time of Installation</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Altho’ we have fully treated of the Ceremony and Manner
of investing a Knight elect, with the <i>Garter</i> and <i>George</i>,
we shall subjoin Two or Three considerable Instances, as
most proper to this Place.</p>

<p class='c000'>When <i>Philip</i>, Prince of <i>Spain</i>, <i>Anno</i> 1 <i>Mariæ</i>, had these
Ensigns of the Order sent him, the Sovereign joyn’d Garter
King of Arms, with the Earl of <i>Arundel</i>, to perform
the Investiture; who, upon notice of his arrival on the
Coast of <i>England</i>, set forward on their Journey to <i>Southampton</i>;
where, on <i>Friday</i> the 20th of <i>July</i>, they took
Water, and meeting the Prince before he landed, entered
his Barge, and gave him notice of his Election in a short
Speech; which being ended, <i>Garter</i> having the Garter in
his Hand, kissed it, and so presented it to the Earl, who
forthwith fasten’d it about the Prince’s Leg; and after
<i>Garter</i> had presented the Earl with the <i>George</i>, hanging
at a Chain of Gold, he put it likewise about the Prince’s
Neck. The Ceremony of Investiture being thus performed,
the Prince came on shore at <i>Southampton</i>; and on
the uppermost Stair were ready attending his landing,
the Marquis of <i>Winchester</i>, Lord High Treasurer of <i>England</i>,
with divers other Lords: The Prince gave the Lord
<i>Williams</i> his White Staff, and made him Lord Chamberlain
of his Houshould; and Sir <i>Anthony Brown</i>, Master of
his Horse, presented him, from the Queen, a Horse with
a Foot-cloth of Crimson Velvet, richly embroider’d with
Gold and Pearls, having the Bridle and all other Furniture
suitable, whereon he rode to the Cathedral, and after
Prayers to the Lodging prepared for him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Concerning the <i>Garter</i>’s Investiture of the Earl of <i>Warwick</i>,
at <i>Newhaven</i> in <i>France</i>, the first of <i>May</i>, <i>Anno</i> 5 <i>Eliz.</i>
is as follows: The <i>Garter</i> repairing first to the Earl’s Lodgings,
put on his Mantle in the next Chamber to the Earl’s,
and proceeded into the Earl’s Chamber; where, having
made Three Reverences, he buckled the Garter about his
left Leg, and after put on the <i>George</i> and the Ribband
about his Neck; reading to the Earl the Words of the
Signification, appointed to be pronounced at the Investiture;
which being concluded, <i>Garter</i> retir’d into the Room
<span class='pageno' title='284' id='Page_284'></span>where he had put on his Mantle, and there disrobed himself,
and so the Ceremony ended.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the Custom about these Times, for the Nobility,
Allies, or Friends, to the elect Knight, to send him
by the <i>Garter</i>, several <i>Garters</i> and <i>Georges</i>, as Marks of
Congratulation for the Honour he was to receive, which
the <i>Garter</i> delivered to him when the Investiture was finished,
and he had put off his Robe, with the particular
Services and Respects of those Friends who had bestow’d
them. For thus was it with the Earl of <i>Warwick</i>, at <i>Newhaven</i>,
and the Lord <i>Scroop</i> at <i>Carlisle</i>, <i>Anno</i> 26 <i>Eliz.</i> At
the <i>Garter</i>’s return to Court, he is obliged to deliver an
Account to the Sovereign, how he hath discharged his
Employment; and by special Directions from the elect
Knight, who presents the highest Respects he can express,
as well to the Sovereign as to the rest of the Knights-Companions,
for honouring him with a Reception into so
illustrious a Body.</p>

<p class='c000'>We shall close this Section with a brief Account of the
Investiture of the Duke of <i>Gloucester</i>, on <i>Easter-day</i> in the
Morning, being the 14th of <i>April</i>, 1653. In reference to
which Ceremony there was provided:</p>

<p class='c006'>1. A <i>Garter</i> with the Motto, to be tyed about his left
Leg.</p>

<p class='c003'>2. A <i>George</i> in a Ribband, to be put about his Neck.</p>

<p class='c003'>3. An embroider’d <i>Cross</i> of St. <i>George</i>, with a <i>Garter</i>
and <i>Star</i>, to be sew’d on the left Shoulder of the Duke’s
Cloak.</p>

<p class='c003'>4. A Velvet Cushion, whereon the <i>Ensigns</i> and <i>Ornaments</i>
of the Order were to be laid.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the Honour of the Order, and his said Highness,
Sir <i>Edward Walker</i>, Garter, humbly proposed, That he
might be assisted by Two or Four Knights in performing
his Duty.</p>

<p class='c000'>That his Highness the Duke might receive the Ensigns
of the Order, in the Presence-Chamber of the Princess
Royal, or in his own, accompanied with the Queen of
<i>Bohemia</i>, her Royal Highness, and some other Persons of
Honour and Quality.</p>

<p class='c000'>That his Highness having placed himself under the State,
<i>Garter</i> should take the Cushion upon his Arms, on which
<span class='pageno' title='285' id='Page_285'></span>were to be laid all the particular Ornaments just now
mentioned; being assisted with the Knights, and a Passage
left for him to make his Three Obeysances, he should
proceed up towards the Duke, and lay the Cushion with
the Ornaments upon a Stool set near his Highness for that
purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>That he should signifie to his Higness, in few Words, the
Cause of his coming, and then deliver into his Hands the
Sovereign’s Letter.</p>

<p class='c000'>That his Highness having receiv’d it, should break it
open, and deliver it back to the <i>Garter</i> to be read; which
he having done, should return it to his Highness.</p>

<p class='c000'>That, after this, he should proceed to the Investiture of
his Highness with the Ensigns of the Order.</p>

<p class='c000'>Which being done, he briefly represented unto his
Highness, in a Speech, somewhat of the Quality and
Splendor of the Order.</p>

<p class='c000'>And, lastly, to kiss his Highness Hand, and so depart.
And according to those Proposals, and in the same Order,
were all Things performed.</p>

<p class='c008'>§ 6. The Sovereign of this most Noble Order defrays
the Charges of the <i>Garter</i>, whensoever, and as often as
he is dispatch’d to any elect Knight-Subject, either with
Letters to signifie his Election, or to invest him with the
<i>Garter</i> and <i>George</i>; and this is commonly proportioned according
to the length or the shortness of the Journey. The
Allowance for the Journey which Sir <i>Gilbert Dithick</i>, Garter,
made into the Counties of <i>Lincoln</i> and <i>Cumberland</i>,
first to the Earl of <i>Rutland</i>, and then to the Lord <i>Scroop</i>,
when Queen <i>Elizabeth</i> was Sovereign, appears to have
been 20 <i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>Besides the Sovereign’s Allowance to the <i>Garter</i>, he receives
honourable Gratuities and Rewards from the elect
Knight himself, after he has performed the Investiture;
and these have usually been proportioned, according to
the estimate of the Honour he receives, and the particular
affection he has for the Garter, and the service done by
him. Among whom, <i>Anno</i> 17 <i>Henry</i> VIII. we find the
Earl of <i>Arundel</i> bestow’d on <i>Thomas Wriothesley</i>, Garter,
ten Pounds in Angelots, being then at his Mannor of
<i>Dawnley</i>; and <i>Ralph</i> Earl of <i>Westmoreland</i>, elected at the
same Time with the aforesaid Earl, being at <i>Mile-end</i>,
<span class='pageno' title='286' id='Page_286'></span>gave to him six Pounds thirteen Shillings and four Pence.
The Earl of <i>Northumberland</i>, in the 23 of <i>Henry</i> VIII.
bestow’d on the Garter, for the verbal certifying him of his
Election, four Pounds, though he went no farther than
the Chapter-House Door.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lastly, <i>Anno</i> 26 <i>Elizabeth</i>, the Earl of <i>Rutland</i> honourably
received the Garter at <i>Newark</i>, and the Lord <i>Scroop</i>
gave him thirty Pounds in Gold, a Velvet Cloak, and a
<i>Gallaway Nag</i>, and to <i>William Dethick</i>, <i>York Herald</i>, who
accompanied Garter to <i>Carlisle</i>, ten Pounds.</p>

<p class='c000'>But since these Times, the Knights elect have enlarged
their gratuities to Garter, for his Service upon this Occasion.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch11' class='c005'>CAP. XI.<br /> <br /><i>Of Preparations for the Personal Installation of a Knight.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>§ 1.</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c009'>THE
Inauguration of a Knight of this most
Noble Order, consists in a Conjunction of
many Ceremonies, and contains the most
solemn part of those, which compleateth all the rest;
and till this great Solemnity be regularly and duly performed,
the Person elected hath not the Honour to be
enrolled among the Number of Founders, but barely
passes for an elect Knight, and no other: For the Statute
expresly says, That in Case a Knight elect die before
his Installation, He shall not be named one of the
Founders; and the reason assigned for it is, because he
hath not had the full Possession of his Estate, and in this
Point do the other Bodies of the Statutes agree. But
when the Ceremonies of Installation are compleatly finished,
without all doubt the Knight is amply vested, in
Possession of all Honours and Privileges appertaining to
the Founder of this most Noble Order. But to spur up
each elect Knight, who is either a Subject to his Sovereign,
or resides within the Realm, (and consequently is
better able to provide for Installment, than one remaining
<span class='pageno' title='287' id='Page_287'></span>in Foreign Parts,) for the completion of his Honour,
or else to wave the Act of Election, he has the space of
one Year allowed him by the Statutes for Installation,
otherwise his Election is ordained to be absolutely null and
void: Nor can there be any Motive sufficient to retard the
Sovereign from proceeding to a new Election, unless the
elect Knight send or produce an Extenuation or Excuse
for such his delay, fit to be excepted by the Sovereign or
his Deputy, and the whole of that resplendent Body, or
that the Sovereign himself think fit to defer the Ceremony
of Installation for some time longer. For which reason,
when certain Articles, tending to the Honour of the Order,
had been prepared by the Sovereign’s Lieutenant and
ten Knights-Companions, in a Chapter held the 24th of
<i>April</i>, <i>Anno</i> 21 <i>Jacobus</i> I. ratified by the Sovereign,
and ordered to be observed; one of them was for accelerating
the Installation, after the Knight had been elected,
yet qualified with this Exception: <i>Unless for some
special Cause the Sovereign shou’d think fit to defer the same
until the Eve or Day of St.</i> George <i>next following, the Time
of Election</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>§ 2. The Feast of Installation hath not been hitherto
assigned to any certain Period of Time, but has always
depended upon the Will and Pleasure of the Sovereign, to
affix a convenient Day, which hath been granted upon
the request of the Knights elect, or some other of the
Knights-Companions, whose Favour and Esteem with
the Sovereign was best able to prevail; such a one do we
find <i>Anno</i> 35 <i>Elizabeth</i>; who, on the behalf of the Earls
of <i>Shrewsbury</i> and <i>Cumberland</i>, obtained the 19th of <i>June</i>
the said Year, to be appointed for the Installation. It
sometimes happens, that though the Day of Installation be
prefixed, yet something extraordinary intervening, it hath
been prorogued to a farther and more convenient Season
for the Sovereign’s Affairs. And the most remarkable Instance
is set down, <i>Anno</i> 3 and 4 <i>Philip</i> and <i>Mary</i>, when
the Earl of <i>Sussex</i>, the Lord <i>Grey</i>, and Sir <i>Robert Rochester</i>,
Knights elect, had their Installation, together with the
Feast of St. <i>George</i>, prorogued to the 10th of <i>May</i> in the
Year aforesaid. But many urgent Affairs, relating both
to the King and the Queen, fell out about that time; not
only the Grand Feast, but the Solemnity of their Installation
<span class='pageno' title='288' id='Page_288'></span>were prorogued to the 5th of <i>December</i>, and stood
so by several Prorogations, to the 20th of <i>February</i> next
ensuing; yet it was ordered that the Earl of <i>Sussex</i> shou’d
be immediately installed, which was performed on the
8th of <i>January</i>, and the Lord <i>Grey</i> the 20th of <i>April</i> following;
but Sir <i>Robert Rochester</i> never obtained that Honour.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though the time of Installation be arbitrary and uncertain,
yet hath the Place, from the first Institution of the
Order, been appointed only to the Sovereign’s Free Chapel
of St. <i>George</i>, within whose Choice are erected the Sovereigns
and Knights-Companions Stalls, and under its
sacred Roof their Banners and Atchievements are affixed,
as Monuments of their high Merit, and so great Honour.
For though the Celebration of the Grand Feast of St. <i>George</i>,
happened to be removed from <i>Windsor</i>, by a Decree of
the 1 <i>Elizabeth</i>; yet the Feast of the Installation was excepted,
and ordered to be Solemniz’d in that Place: For
<i>Anno</i> 21 <i>Jac.</i> I. it was provided among the Orders,
<i>That after an Election made of a Knight of the Order, his
Installation shou’d be performed at</i> Windsor, <i>according to the
ancient Customs and Statutes of the Order</i>. When the Sovereign
hath been pleased to prefix a certain Day for this
Solemnity of Installation, there are several things to be
obtained, previous to it. (1.) A Commission to admit
and instal the elect Knight. (2.) Letters to each of the
Commissioners, and the elect Knight, to repair to <i>Windsor</i>.
(3.) Warrants for the Sovereign’s Livery. (4.) A
Bill or Warrant for the removal of Stalls and Atchievements,
all signed by the Chancellor of the Order, with
the Sign Manual of the Sovereign: And lastly, the Knights
own Preparations; among which his Atchievements are
to be ready to be hung up, as soon as he is installed.</p>

<p class='c008'>§ 3. No elect Knight can be installed, unless by the
Sovereign of the Order himself, or by his Commission
drawn up in Writing, and passed under the Great-Seal of
the Order, directed either to his Lieutenant or Knights-Commissioners.
There is but one Instance to be found,
where the Sovereign hath been pleased to Honour a
Knight by installing of him himself; and that was <i>Philip</i>
of <i>Castile</i> and <i>Leon</i>, <i>Anno</i> 22 <i>Henry</i> VII. yet it is feasible
enough that <i>Sigismond</i> the Emperor, and some other Foreign
<span class='pageno' title='289' id='Page_289'></span>Princes of Rank and Eminence, might be installed
by other Sovereigns, though there’s no Memorial left upon
Record. <i>In reference to Installation by Commission, it was
ordained by the Statutes of Institution; That in Case the Sovereign
shou’d be absent out of the Kingdom, at the Time of
Installation of any of the Knights, so as he could not personally
perform those things his Office obliged him to, it
shou’d be Lawful for him to Constitute, as his Deputy in
this Affair, whomsoever of the Society he shou’d think fit; and
he to have Power and Authority, in the Sovereign’s Name, to
Perform and Execute these Things, which it wou’d have been
in his own part to have done, had he been Present.</i> By Virtue
of this Article, the Sovereign’s Deputy, or Lieutenant,
performed the Ceremony before the Reign of King <i>Henry</i>
VIII. which was usually done at the Feast of St. <i>George</i>;
but in the Commission given out for Installation, formerly
the Lieutenant was first mentioned, and the Knights-Companions
appointed for his Assistance at the said Feast,
were joined with him in the Commission for Installation;
but of late, the Commission hath passed to the Lieutenant
alone. King <i>Henry</i> VIII. by his Statutes, enlarged
the Power of his Deputy, and they run to two or more
of the Knights-Companions, that shou’d Exercise the same
by the Sovereign’s Letters of Commission. And by the
Privilege of this Article, whensoever after, the Sovereign’s
did Constitute an Installation, otherwise than at the
Feast of St. <i>George</i>, they then delegated their Authority
to such of the Knights-Companions as were judged most
proper to perform this Ceremony. The Year after the
enacting this Statute, there’s a Commission recorded to
be issued out to the Marquiss of <i>Dorset</i>, and the Earls of
<i>Devonshire</i> and <i>Kent</i>, to Instal the Lords <i>Ferrers</i> of <i>Chartley</i>,
the substance of which is in our Annals. The particular
Powers these Commissions have granted to them,
are to accept and admit the Knight into the Order, to receive
the Oath, and to Instal him; And their general
Power is, to effect and accomplish every Point which belongs
to his due Admittance, and plenary Instalment.</p>

<p class='c008'>§ 4. Besides, the Commission impowering the Sovereign’s
Lieutenant, or Knights-Commissioners, therein
nominated to the Installation of an elect Knight, it hath
been a matter frequent with the Sovereign, to Issue out
<span class='pageno' title='290' id='Page_290'></span>Letters of Summons under his privy Signet, both to the
Commissioners for Installation, and elect Knights, under
the signet of the Order; those to the Commissioners are
directed severally to each, nominated in the Commission;
who are to give them notice of the Instalment, and to require
their repair to <i>Windsor</i>, against the Day assigned,
that they may proceed to their Installation. Those directed
to the elect Knights, pass likewise under the Sovereign’s
Sign Manual, and Signet of the Order; and if
there be two or more Knights appointed to be Installed
on the same Day, the like Letter is sent to each of them,
the difference being only in the Direction.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides these Letters sent from the Sovereign, the
Chancellor (if the Sovereign be absent,) in his circular
Letter to the Knights-Companions, gives them an intimation
of the designed Installation, upon the Feast of St.
<i>George</i>. And if the Feast be held either by the Sovereign
or his Lieutenant, he dispatcheth a Letter to the Prelate
of the Order, intimating the Sovereign’s Commands for
his attendance at the Day appointed; and if it be performed
by Commissioners, he issues his Letters to the
three inferior Officers of the Order, purporting the same
Command; the conveyance of which appertains to the
Garter, and are left to his Care, and Trust, by the Constitutions
relating to the Order, whose allowances and
rewards upon these and such like Services, in their due
Place, shall be considered.</p>

<p class='c008'>§ 5. The third matter to be obtained by the Chancellor
of the Order, is the Sovereign’s Warrant, directed for the
Master of the Great Wardrobe, for the Time being, to
deliver so much Velvet for the Livery of the Order, as
will make the Knight elect a Surcoat and Hood, and as
much Sarcenet or Taffety as will serve to line them: Of
such a Warrant there is an ancient Precedent in Latin,
entered in the Black Book of the Order; where it runs,
<i>Nos ideo volumus &amp; præcipimus, ut hinc Tabellioni virgas
Octodecem subrubri ostri de more tradas, cum tanto albo serico,
quanto vestimentum inde conficiendum infulciri poterit, pro
liverata (quam vocant) sua, &amp;c.</i> There is likewise inserted
another Precedent in English of the like Nature, for the
delivery of these Materials to Sir <i>John Wallop</i> Kt. elected
<span class='pageno' title='291' id='Page_291'></span><i>Anno</i> 38 <i>Henry</i> VIII. and in the same Form run all the
Warrants of Queen <i>Mary</i> and Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Over and above these, there is a Warrant and Scheme
prepared for the Sovereign to Sign, wherein is described
the Order of the Stalls of <i>Windsor</i>, as he wou’d have them
stand at the ensuing Election; by the Virtue of which,
the Garter is impowered to shift or remove the Plates
and Atchievements of the present Knights-Companions, so
that room may be made for the elect Knight, or Knights,
and to fix the new Plates and Atchievements within, and
over the Stalls, in such order as they are rank’d in the
Scheme. As soon as the Sovereign’s Pleasure is known
concerning an Installation, Garter brings to the Chancellor
of the Order, the Names of the present Knights-Companions,
placed in the order they then fit in their Stalls, to
the intent he may present them to the Sovereign; who,
upon observing the series wherein they stand already, he
may easier determine how to alter and place both them,
and the new elect Knights. <i>Anno</i> 27 <i>Elizabeth</i>, the Office
of the Garter being Vacant, this employ was put upon
the Clarenceux, and the Sovereign’s Warrant for removal
and placing of Plates and Atchievements, was delivered
to him, five Days before the Installation of the Earl of
<i>Rutland</i>, the Lords <i>Cobham</i> and <i>Scroop</i>, who thereupon
fixed them according to the direction given; upon what
Ground this alteration and removal came to be made,
and continues still in Vogue, though it was otherwise at
the Institution of the Order, wherein we must have recourse
to the Statutes, and the antique Practice grounded
upon them: Among the Statutes, those of the Institution
did ordain, That if any Earl, Baron, or Knight-Batchellor,
shou’d depart this Life, he that succeeded in his Place, of
what Condition or State soever, shou’d possess the same
Stall which his Predecessor held before, without changing:
So that it might happen for an Earl, or a Duke, to succeed
a Knight, and, <i>vice versa</i>, it was thus at first
constituted by <i>Edward</i> III. <i>that it might be known who were
the first Founders of this most Noble Order</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now how punctually this Article of the Statutes hath
been observed, that none Chosen along time after the Institution
of the Order, shou’d interrupt or change this
course, we shall demonstrate, conceiving it very material
to eye those Tables, yet preserved in the Chapter-House
<span class='pageno' title='292' id='Page_292'></span>in <i>Windsor</i>, wherein are collected the Names of all those
Knights-Companions who succeeded one another in each
Stall, until the beginning of <i>Henry</i> VII’s Reign.</p>

<p class='c000'>From which Series of Succession, we shall remark how
exactly the Law in this Point hath been observed, even to
King <i>Henry</i> VIII’s Reign, when it received some alteration
in this Point. For we find in the Annals several
Knights designed for the Stall of their immediate Predecessors,
by the Honour only of Election, although prevented
of Installation by Death, or other accidents; and
the Statutes do not only bind him who shall chance to
attain the Honour of Installation, <i>but him who shall succeed
or come after the Defunct Knight</i>. First therefore we shall
Instance in Foreign Kings, among whom we find <i>Ericus</i>
King of <i>Denmark</i>, to have received <i>Installation</i> in <i>Henry</i> V’s
Reign, not according to the State and Dignity of a King,
but into the Stall of that Knight-Companion whom he
succeeded, <i>viz.</i> the Duke of <i>Bavaria</i>. <i>John</i> the first King
of <i>Portugal</i>, a Knight and Companion, likewise in <i>Henry</i>
V’s Time, was installed in the second Stall on the Sovereign’s
Side, which belong’d to <i>Henry</i> Duke of <i>Lancaster</i>,
his first Predecessor: And to this King did succeed,
in the same Stall, his Son <i>Edward</i> King of <i>Portugal</i>, <i>Anno</i>
13 <i>Henry</i> VI. to whose Successor <i>Humphry</i>, <i>Anno</i> 34, and
<i>Casimir</i> King of <i>Poland</i> were elected, <i>Anno</i> 28 <i>Henry</i> VI.
into the sixth Stall on the Prince’s side, at that Time vacant
by the Death of the Duke <i>Conimbero</i>, whose first Founder
was Sir <i>John Mohun</i>. <i>Alphonsus</i> King of <i>Arragon</i> and <i>Naples</i>,
<i>Anno</i> 38 <i>Henry</i> VI. was elected into the Stall of
<i>Don Altro Vasques Dalmedea Count d’Averence</i>, being the
seventh on the Sovereign’s side, Sir <i>Hugh Courtney</i> first possessing
it. <i>Ferdinand</i> King of <i>Naples</i> and <i>Sicily</i>, elected
<i>Anno</i> 3 <i>Edward</i> IV. was installed on the third on the
Prince’s side, <i>Ralph</i> Earl of <i>Stafford</i> having been first installed
therein. And lastly, we find <i>Alphonsus</i> King of
<i>Sicily</i> and <i>Jerusalem</i>, being elected by <i>Henry</i> VII. received
his Installation on the Prince’s side, whose Predecessor was
<i>Thomas Beauchamp</i> Earl of <i>Warwick</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the second Place, if we descend to Foreign Princes,
it is remarkable, that <i>William</i> Duke of <i>Gueldres</i>, elected
by <i>Richard</i> II. was installed in that which Sir <i>John Beauchamp</i>
possessed, and <i>William</i> Earl of <i>Holland</i>, <i>Haynalt</i>,
<span class='pageno' title='293' id='Page_293'></span>and <i>Zealand</i>, in that which appertained to Sir <i>John Chandos</i>.
<i>Philip</i> Duke of <i>Burgundy</i>, in the Time of <i>Henry</i> V.
into the Stall of Sir <i>John Clifford</i>. And <i>Anno</i> 28 <i>Henry</i> VI.
<i>Henry</i> Duke of <i>Brunswick</i> was elected into the Duke of
<i>Suffolk</i>’s Stall.</p>

<p class='c000'>And as the Statute was carefully observed, with reference
to the Election and Installation of Foreign Princes,
so no less in relation to the Princes of the Blood
at Home; among whom let us observe, in the third
Place, the ranking the Sons of the Founder of this most
Noble Order; where we see <i>Lyonel</i> Duke of <i>Clarence</i>
his third Son, to have been installed in the sixth Stall
on the Sovereign’s side, whose immediate Predecessor
was Sir <i>John Beauchamp</i>: In like manner <i>John</i> of
<i>Gaunt</i>, Duke of <i>Lancaster</i>, his fourth Son was installed
in the seventh Stall on the Prince’s side, having Sir
<i>Thomas Holland</i> for his Predecessor and a Founder:
His fifth Son <i>Edmund Langley</i>, Duke of <i>York</i>, possess’d
the Stall Sir <i>Hugh Courtney</i> did before: And the sixth
Son, <i>Thomas Woodstock</i>, Duke of <i>Gloucester</i>, enjoy’d
the Stall Sir <i>John Grey</i> did before: This Rule was
likewise observed strictly in relation to the Sons of
King <i>Henry</i> VII.</p>

<p class='c000'>If we review the aforesaid Tables, we shall find, that
as the Knights-Companions of higher Dignity assumed the
Stalls, (when they became vacant) though often of the
lower sort, so some of the inferior rank among them
have had the Honour to be installed in Seats of a superior
Class, and this by the virtue and due of the Law.</p>

<p class='c000'>Amongst these Knights-Companions we shall enumerate
Sir <i>Philip la Vache</i>, a <i>Gascon</i>, who, in the Reign of King
<i>Richard</i> II. was first installed in the Prince’s Stall, (being
vacant by the Death of <i>John</i> of <i>Gaunt</i>,) though afterwards
removed to the third Stall on the Sovereign’s side. Sir
<i>Nicholas Sarnesfield</i>, Standard-bearer to the Founder, who
succeeded <i>Hugh</i> Earl of <i>Stafford</i>, and after him Sir <i>William
Arundel</i>, immediate Successor to Sir <i>Nicholas</i>, were
both installed in the second Stall on the Sovereign’s side:
As likewise Sir <i>John Robsart</i>, Sir <i>Gilbert Talbot</i>, and Sir
<i>John Grey</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> were installed in the second or third Stalls
on the Sovereign’s side.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='294' id='Page_294'></span>These Instances already asserted, are sufficient to manifest
the Usage and Practice, how the Knights-Companions
have succeeded in the Stalls of their immediate Predecessors,
down to the Reign of <i>Henry</i> VIII. and was
consonant and agreeable to the ancient Law of the Order.</p>

<p class='c000'>But we are to observe, that tho’ each Knight was, by
the before-mentioned Article, constituted to succeed his
immediate Predecessor, in the Stall void by his Death,
yet there’s an exception as to that of the Prince of <i>Wales</i>.
This Stall is the first on the left Hand, at the entrance
into the Choir of St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Chappel</i> at <i>Windsor</i>, and
wherein <i>Edward</i> the Black Prince was installed; from this
Stall does the whole range of Stalls on the same side take
their Denomination, and to which the Prince of <i>Wales</i>,
as soon as he is elected into the Order, hath a due Title.
Though this Stall <i>de Jure</i> appertains to that Prince, yet
heretofore, when the Sovereign had no Heir, then was it
for the present disposed to some other Knight, otherwise
a defect in the full Number of Knights-Companions would
have ensued.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first that obtained that Honour, (besides the Prince of
<i>Wales</i>,) was <i>John</i> of <i>Gaunt</i>, Duke of <i>Lancaster</i>, decreed him
by K. <i>Richard</i> II. who never had Issue, and removed from
the seventh Stall thither. But the first Companion that
happened to be installed in it, was Sir <i>Philip la Vache</i> just
mentioned, which was a great Honour done to one of his
Rank: But it fell to him by the then Law of the Order,
being elected into the Room of the said Duke, who died
possessed of it. But King <i>Henry</i> IV. coming to the Crown,
and his eldest Son being created Prince of <i>Wales</i>, laid claim
to the Stall by Virtue of that Statute, and had it assigned
to him. Nevertheless, that the former Possessor
might suffer as little diminution as might be in the Honour
of his Session, he was removed no lower than to the
Stall which King <i>Henry</i> IV. lately held, when he was Earl
of <i>Derby</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon the Death of <i>Henry</i> IV. <i>Henry</i> V. being Sovereign,
Sir <i>John Dabrichcourt</i> supplyed the vacancy, and
was installed therein; and he dying in the fifth Year of that
King possess’d thereof, his Plate continues in that Stall to
this Day, and the Emperor <i>Sigismond</i> succeeds Sir <i>John
Dabrichcourt</i> in the Prince’s Stall.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='295' id='Page_295'></span>Some few Years before King <i>Henry</i> VI. died, he had a
Son Born; and though the Emperor <i>Frederick</i> was elected
into the Order, <i>Anno</i> 35 <i>Henry</i> VI. yet was that Stall
reserved for the Prince, (though he never possess’d it) and
the Emperor 37 <i>Henry</i> VI. was installed by Proxy in
the Duke of <i>Somerset</i>’s Stall, then lately deceased.</p>

<p class='c000'>In <i>Edward</i> IV’s Reign, the right of this Stall returned
again to <i>Edward</i> his Son, the Prince of <i>Wales</i>, and in
<i>Henry</i> VII’s, to Prince <i>Arthur</i>, but upon his Death, to
<i>Maximilian</i>, Son of <i>Frederick</i> King of the <i>Romans</i>, and after
Emperor, enjoyed it. So did the Emperor <i>Charles</i> V.
(his Grandchild,) in regard there was no Son as yet Born
to the Sovereign.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Prince <i>Edward</i> being Born, while the Stall was
possessed by <i>Charles</i> V. it chanc’d likewise that the King
of the <i>Scots</i> died, which caus’d King <i>Henry</i> VIII. to reserve
his Stall for that Prince, although he never had Possession
of it, or was elected into the Order, though we
find him once registred in a Scrutiny. King <i>Henry</i> VIII.
dying, Prince <i>Edward</i> became, both by Inheritance and
Succession, Sovereign of this most Noble Order.</p>

<p class='c000'>From this Time, to the eighth Year of King <i>James</i> I.
there was no Prince of <i>Wales</i>, who finding the Prince’s
Stall vacant, at his entrance upon the English Throne,
did in a Chapter in the first Year of his Reign, advance
the French King <i>Henry</i> IV. from the second Stall on the
Sovereign’s side, into it; and appointed Prince <i>Henry</i> to be
installed in that King’s void Seat, where he continued
till <i>Anno</i> 3 <i>Jac.</i> I. that <i>Christierne</i> IV. King of <i>Denmark</i>,
came to be installed by Proxy, and the Prince was moved
lower to make way for him, though he was Senior both
by Election and Installation. <i>Anno</i> 9 <i>Jac.</i> I. upon the
Death of the French King, not the Prince, whose Right
it was, since he was created Prince of <i>Wales</i>, but the
said King of <i>Denmark</i>, was translated to the vacant Stall;
and hereupon Prince <i>Henry</i> was returned again to the second
Stall on the Sovereign’s side, which he enjoyed as
long as he survived, and upon his Death, Prince <i>Charles</i> was
removed into it, and there remained all King <i>James</i>’s
Reign.</p>

<p class='c000'>When King <i>Charles</i> II. came to be installed, the Sovereign
finding him prevented from assuming the Prince’s
Stall, the King of <i>Denmark</i> being yet alive, assigned to
<span class='pageno' title='296' id='Page_296'></span>him the second Stall on the Sovereign’s side, (wherein himself
sat whilst Prince of <i>Wales</i>,) and where hitherto his
Plate remains as a fixed Memorial of his Installation
therein.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although it has been made apparent, that the <i>Knights-Companions</i>,
at their Election or Installation, succeeded the
immediate <i>defunct Knight</i> in his Stall, yet we may observe,
that sometimes after Installation, as an especial signal
of Favour and Indulgence, the Sovereign hath been
pleased, though very rarely, to advance a <i>Knight-Companion</i>
to a higher Stall than that wherein he was first
placed; and though there be no such Permission granted
by the Law of the Order, yet we find <i>John</i> of <i>Gaunt</i>, Duke
of <i>Lancaster</i>, removed from the seventh Stall on the Prince’s
side, to the Prince’s Stall it self, and it’s said to be done
by the Decree of the Sovereign and the <i>Knights-Companions</i>.
And no doubt but as this was done by so good
Authority, and so upon no less enducements to the Sovereign,
and the whole Society. We shall here mention a
few of these extraordinary Cases. <i>William Henalt</i>, Earl of
<i>Ostervant</i>, was advanced by King <i>Richard</i> II. from the
eleventh Stall on the Sovereign’s side, to the Duke of
<i>Britain</i>’s, being the second on the Prince’s side. <i>Humphry</i>
Duke of <i>Gloucester</i>, in the Reign of King <i>Henry</i> VI. was
removed from the eleventh Stall on the Sovereign’s side,
to the second on the same side; and <i>Richard Nevil</i>, Earl of
<i>Warwick</i>, by the Consent of the <i>Knights-Companions</i> in
Chapter, <i>Anno</i> 39 <i>Henry</i> VI. was translated to the Duke
of <i>Buckingham</i>’s Stall; the Lord <i>Bonvil</i>, to the Lord <i>Scales</i>’s
Seat; Sir <i>Thomas Kyriell</i>, to the Place of the Earl of
<i>Shrewsbury</i>; and the Lord <i>Wenlock</i>, to the Stall of Viscount
<i>Beaumont</i>. But King <i>Henry</i> VIII. thinking it requisite
for the Sovereign of this most Noble Order, to be impowered
by a General, how to Act that at Pleasure, which
the former Sovereigns did not, but by the Power of particular
Acts, or Orders, in the Chapter; after he had
confirmed the ancient Law of succeeding in the Stall of
the immediate Predecessor, and not to suffer an alteration
without the Sovereign’s Licence, in the next Article he
established this Privilege upon Himself and Successors:
<i>That if there were any Place or Stall void, the Sovereign, at
his own Pleasure, might Advance and Translate any Knight
<span class='pageno' title='297' id='Page_297'></span>of the Society into the void Stall, so that it were higher
than that, wherein he sate before</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>This in Effect did vacat the ancient Law of succeeding
in Stalls, though at the same Time he seem’d to Confirm
it to the <i>Knights-Subjects</i>, for afterwards Translations preceeding
to Installations, became so frequent, that the Right
an <i>elect Knight</i> had to his Predecessor’s Stall, was seldom
enjoyed. However, hereby he confirmed a Power to
gratify such of the <i>Knights-Companions</i>, as he shou’d think
fit to advance, without having recourse to a Chapter;
and from hence began the Custom to Issue out Warrants,
under the Sovereign’s <i>Sign Manual</i>, for the Translation of
Stalls, and consequently the alteration and removal of such
of the <i>Knights-Companions Helms</i>, <i>Crests</i>, <i>Banners</i>, and
<i>Plates</i>, who shou’d receive a higher Exaltation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides the Power established upon the Sovereigns of
this most Noble Order, of translating Stalls, when a vacancy
happened, they farther added this larger Prerogative:
That the Sovereign, once in his Life, might, if it
pleased him, make a general Translation of all the Stalls
at his Pleasure, except of Emperors, Kings, Princes, and
Dukes, who shou’d keep their Stalls and Places, unless
advanced to a higher Room and Stall. In which Translation,
the long continuance in the Order, and the Praises,
Worthiness, and Merits of the <i>Knights-Companions</i>, were
to be considered and remembred.</p>

<p class='c000'>But this Branch of the Sovereign’s Prerogative, as far
as we can find, was never put in Execution, though the
Translation, <i>Anno</i> 27 <i>Henry</i> VIII. border’d something
upon it, perhaps lest it might raise too great Feuds among
the <i>Knights-Subjects</i>; forasmuch as that of translating only,
(when there happened a vacancy,) begot great Emulations,
which at length introduced a Change, to which we shall
pass, after we have taken notice of a Clause added in the
twenty second Article of King <i>Henry</i> VIII’s Statutes, relating
to Princes.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is observable the ancient Law of succeeding in Stalls,
in relation to them, was wholly altered. For King
<i>Henry</i> VIII. upon the Establishment of his Body of Statutes,
not only appointed those Strangers, then present of
the Order, to be seated next himself; but that all Emperors,
Kings, and Princes, should hold their Stalls after
their Estates, and the very next unto the Sovereign, tho’
<span class='pageno' title='298' id='Page_298'></span><i>Knights-Subjects</i>, upon vacancy, become removable at
Pleasure.</p>

<p class='c000'>For this reason, the Emperor <i>Maximilian</i> II. and after
him <i>Rudolph</i> II. his Son, had the Prince’s Stalls assigned
them after their Election into the Order; and several of
the Kings of <i>France</i> were placed in the next below, being
the second on the Sovereign’s side. And when there
chanced to be more than one King at a time in the Order,
the second Stall on the Prince’s side was assigned him;
for Precedency was measured now by Dignity and State,
and not by the Antiquity of the Order; As appears from
the King of <i>Bohemia</i>, <i>Anno</i> 19 <i>Henry</i> VIII. and the King
of <i>Spain</i>, <i>Anno</i> 8 <i>Elizabeth</i>, Princes Strangers, according
to their regality, and illustrious extraction, had their
Scituation next to Kings, as is manifest from the Dukes
of <i>Savoy</i>, <i>Montmorency</i>, and <i>Holstein</i>, <i>Anno</i> 3 <i>Elizabeth</i>,
and <i>Frederick</i> Prince <i>Palatine</i>, and <i>Maurice</i> Prince of
<i>Orange</i>, <i>Anno</i> 11 <i>Jac.</i> I.</p>

<p class='c000'>But notwithstanding these Assignments of Stalls to Strangers,
they were nevertheless subject to removal, sometimes
to Stalls higher than their own, upon the Death of a
Stranger, who died possessed of a superior one; and sometimes
again to others lower, for the advancing a Knight
of greater Degree and Distinction, where the upper Stalls
were already supplied; else they could not be so ranked,
according to their respective Quality, as the Statutes enjoyn;
nor indeed wou’d any Stranger King have accepted
of an Election, unless he was placed in a distinguishable
Stall, suitable to his Dignity. <i>Ferdinand</i>, Emperor
of <i>Germany</i>, is an instance of Advancement in translation
of Stalls; for after the Death of the Emperor
<i>Charles</i> V. his Brother, he was advanced from the second
Stall on the Prince’s side, into the Prince’s Stall. And
<i>Henry</i> IV. of <i>France</i>, from the second on the Sovereign’s
side, to the Prince’s Stall, and <i>Christierne</i> IV. King of
<i>Denmark</i>, <i>Anno</i> 9 <i>Jac.</i> I.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among Princes Strangers, we find <i>Emanuel</i> Duke of
<i>Savoy</i>, advanced from the third on the Prince’s side, to the
second on the same side, <i>Anno</i> 2 <i>Elizabeth</i>; and <i>Frederick</i>
Prince Palatine, <i>Anno</i> 1 <i>Charles</i> I. was advanced from the
second of the Prince’s, to the second on the side of the
Sovereign; likewise <i>Henry Frederick</i>, Prince of <i>Orange</i>;
was advanced from the third of the Sovereign’s, to the
<span class='pageno' title='299' id='Page_299'></span>second of the Prince’s, upon the Death of the King of
<i>Sweden</i>, <i>Anno</i> 10 <i>Charles</i> I.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the <i>French</i> King <i>Charles</i> IX. was elected, <i>Anno</i>
6 <i>Elizabeth</i>, the superior Stalls were already filled with
Strangers, and there was no Expedient left to give him
the Stall the Sovereign design’d him, but by the removal
of some of those <i>Knights-Strangers</i> lower; and upon this,
<i>Emanuel</i> Duke of <i>Savoy</i> was displaced to the third on
the Sovereign’s side.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the <i>French</i> King was not installed, until the 16th
of <i>January</i>, <i>Anno</i> 8 <i>Elizabeth</i>, and before that it was concluded
to remove the King of <i>Spain</i> to the Duke of <i>Savoy</i>’s
Stall, as void before, and to instal the <i>French</i> King in
the King of <i>Spain</i>’s, which was accordingly done; so that
upon this occasion, there were four Strangers, and five
<i>Knights-Subjects</i>, removed lower, to make way for the
<i>French</i> King.</p>

<p class='c000'>The 20th of <i>April</i>, <i>Anno</i> 2 <i>Jac.</i> I. The Duke of <i>Wirtemberg</i>
was installed in the third Stall on the Prince’s
side, and the Year following advanced to a higher.</p>

<p class='c000'>The 26th of <i>May</i> ensuing, <i>Ulerick</i> Duke <i>Holst</i>, had assigned
unto him that Stall from which the Duke of <i>Wirtemberg</i>
was advanced: But against the Installation of
<i>Christierne</i>, the fourth King of <i>Denmark</i>, the Duke was
removed back to his Seat, wherein he was installed, and
the Duke advanced into the vacant one. All which will
appear more conspicuous, from the appointment of Stalls
on these Occasions, which follow.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this last Scheme, we find Prince <i>Henry</i> removed from
the second on the Sovereign’s, to the second on the Prince’s
side, to make room for the King of <i>Denmark</i>. And tho’
the Duke <i>Chevereux</i>, <i>Anno</i> 3 <i>Charles</i> I. was advanced from
the third Stall on the Sovereign’s side, to the second on
the Prince’s side, that became vacant by the Death of the
Duke of <i>Brunswick</i>; yet the Year after, upon the admission
of <i>Gustavus Adolphus</i>, King of <i>Sweden</i>, he was removed
two Stalls lower, and the Prince Elector Palatine
one.</p>

<p class='c000'>We pass on now from the removal and translation of a
<i>Knight-Subject</i>, after he had been installed, to the assignment
of his Stall, at the Time of the Installation it self;
where it is worthy of Remark, That on the 24th of <i>April</i>,
<i>Anno</i> 6 <i>Elizabeth</i>, in lieu of the ancient Law, which appointed
each elect Knight to succeed in the Stall of his
Predecessor, a new one was introduced, being composed,
as was conceived, upon a more just level than the former,
and as far as was possible, to extinguish all danger that might
arise from Emulation. The Words are: <i>That all Knights,
who for the future were admitted into the Society of the Order,
should take and be installed in the lowest Stall, according to
the Course and Seniority of their Election, except only Stranger
Kings and Princes</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon which it chanced, that when a <i>Knight-Subject</i>
elect was to be installed, all the <i>Knights-Companions</i>,
between him and the vacant Stall, were removed higher,
that the space might be supplied: And if two or more
were to be installed together, they possessed the lowest
Stalls, according to the Seniority of their Election. And
though the manner and order in removals, is become a
thing of course, and rendered familiar and easy; yet it
cannot be effected, or the Atchievements, Banners, or
Plates, displaced, unless by a Warrant issued from the
Sovereign, to justify the Garter for such his removals;
which will plainly appear by the insertion of these
Schemes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first of these Schemes plainly evince, how the

<span class='pageno' title='303' id='Page_303'></span>Hatton</i>, the 23d of <i>May</i>, <i>Anno</i> 30 <i>Elizabeth</i>, which demonstrates
those three elect Knights appear to be installed
in the lowermost Stalls, (as the last mentioned
Decree enjoyns,) and by reason the Earl of <i>Essex</i>, and
Sir <i>Christopher Hatton</i>, were settled on the Sovereign’s
side, the vacancy in the eighth and twelfth Stalls of the
same side became filled up; the Earl of <i>Huntington</i> being
advanced into the eighth, the Lord <i>Grey</i> in the ninth,
and the Earl of <i>Pembrook</i> in the tenth Stall, by the advance
of the Earl of <i>Worcester</i> into the seventh on the
Prince’s side, the vacancy is there supplyed, and the other
Knights seated below him, by a like removal, left the
twelfth Stall for the Earl of <i>Ormond</i>, and the thirteenth
void.</p>

<p class='c000'>The same Order was observ’d by King <i>James</i>, as appears

<p class='c008'>From hence it is evident, that these elect Knights were
installed in the lowest Stalls, and so continued throughout
the series of his Reign, and since, except the Prince of
<i>Wales</i>, and <i>Charles</i> Duke of <i>York</i>, Sons to the said Sovereign:
For the Prince was installed on the second on the
<span class='pageno' title='304' id='Page_304'></span>Sovereign’s side, and upon that Election of the Duke of
<i>York</i>, <i>Anno Jac.</i> I. the second Stall on the Prince’s side
was assigned him, and the Morrow after St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Day</i>,
upon which he was elected, he made a solemn Progression
to the Chapel, in order to take Possession of it. Upon
<i>Whitsunday</i> following, at a serious Debate, it was determined
in Chapter, that notwithstanding he was the Sovereign’s
Son, yet he shou’d have no more Preheminence
than other <i>Knights-Companions</i>, and that his Atchievements,
which had been set up over the second Stall on
the Prince’s side, shou’d be removed to that Stall next
above the Viscount <i>Rochester</i>’s, and to be conserted with
the Earl of <i>Montgomery</i>, before whom he had the Preference,
on <i>Whitsun-Munday</i>, as they proceeded to the Chapter-House,
in order to their Installation. And where it
was farther Decreed, <i>That all Princes not Absolute, shou’d
be installed thenceforth in the Prince’s Place</i>. But after this
had passed, Endeavours were used to advance the Duke
into the Stall he was first appointed to, and the Kings of
Arms were consulted upon this Point; who certified, that
<i>Richard</i> Duke of <i>York</i>, second Son to King <i>Edward</i> IV.
was installed in the fourth Stall on the Prince’s side, and
had Precedence of the Duke of <i>Suffolk</i>, and the Earls of
<i>Dowglass</i> and <i>Essex</i>, who were elected long before him:
That <i>Henry</i> Duke of <i>York</i>, second Son to King <i>Henry</i> VII.
was installed in the third Stall on the Sovereign’s side,
and had the Preference of the Duke of <i>Buckingham</i>, and
the Earls of <i>Oxford</i> and <i>Derby</i>, his Seniors; and in the
last Place, that <i>Henry Fitz Roy</i>, Duke of <i>Richmond</i>, base
Son of King <i>Henry</i> VIII. had Place and Precedence
before the Dukes of <i>Norfolk</i> and <i>Suffolk</i>, and other
<i>Knights-Companions</i>. Upon which Grounds it was thought
requisite that the Issue of the Sovereign should enjoy the
same Privileges in this Affair, as those Princes that were
Strangers; and therefore at another Chapter assembled at
<i>White-Hall</i>, on <i>Easter-Monday</i>, being the 13th of <i>April</i>,
<i>Anno</i> 10 <i>Jac.</i> I. the Order which passed the Year before,
for making the Duke a Puisne, was abrogated, and he
was translated to the second Stall on the Prince’s side, and
paired with Prince <i>Henry</i>, as may be seen by the Stalls
then settled, and entered into the Blue Book of the
Order.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='305' id='Page_305'></span>We need not bring any more corroborating Circumstances
of the Observation of the Chapter Act, made <i>Anno</i>
6 <i>Elizabeth</i>, as it relates to <i>Knights-Subjects</i>, which has
been punctually performed; but since Strangers are therein
excepted, it will not be amiss to note, that the Rule and
Practice continued as was established by King <i>Henry</i> VIII.
<i>viz.</i> that they were installed in Seats next to the Sovereign,
according to the illustriousness of their Dignity and
Birth.</p>

<p class='c000'>We shall mention one Instance, of the manner of placing
both Strangers and Knights-Subjects at one and the same
Time. At the first coming of King <i>Charles</i> I. to the Crown,
there were of both Conditions to be installed in one Day,
to wit, the Duke of <i>Brunswick</i> a Stranger Prince, the
Earls of <i>Salisbury</i> and <i>Carlisle</i>, <i>Knights-Subjects</i>, elected
by King <i>James</i> I. in the 22d Year of his Reign, and on
the 15th of <i>May</i> following, the Earls of <i>Dorset</i> and <i>Holland</i>
were elected with the Viscount <i>Andover</i>, and the Duke
of <i>Chevereux</i> the 4th of <i>July</i> after. And when the removal
of Stalls was propounded for the Admission of these
seven elect Knights, it was agreed too, that the Dukes of
<i>Brunswick</i> and <i>Chevereux</i> shou’d be installed in the uppermost
Stall among Strangers, as King <i>Henry</i> VIII. had
before ordained, but the <i>Knights-Subjects</i> in the lowermost
Stalls, according to the pristine Practice, as appears from
the Decree, <i>Anno</i> 6 <i>Elizabeth</i>, and from the settlement
of Stalls then made, and thus intituled. ·</p>

St. <i>George</i>, and Installation holden at <i>Windsor</i>,
the 13, 14, 15 Days of <i>December</i>, <i>Anno</i> 1625.
At which time were installed the Dukes of
<i>Brunswick</i>, and <i>Chevereux</i>, the Earls of <i>Salisbury</i>,
<i>Carlisle</i>, <i>Holland</i>, <i>Dorset</i>, and the Viscount <i>Andover</i>,

<p class='c008'>After the Restauration of King <i>Charles</i> II. to his Crown

Strangers and Subjects, were to be installed, a Debate
arose in the Chapter held at <i>White-Hall</i>, the 10th of

Pre-election, in Point of Rank and Precedency, in respect
of some of our Subject-Knights, who, though since
elected, will be first installed, without some Expedient
taken therein to prevent it. There being no reason, (nor is it
our intention) that those noble Persons shou’d suffer that
prejudice, for want of that usual formality, and for which
they are not in the fault, but others, who, according to
the Statutes and ancient Custom, were to give timely
Advertisement to the said Foreign elected Knights, and
to Summon them by themselves or Proxies, to assist at
the said Instalment: Our Will and Pleasure is, you proceed
forthwith to the placing of the Hatchments of all
the respective Knights and Companions of our said Order,

Day practised.</p>

<p class='c000'>However of late the Sovereign hath been pleased, now
and then, to confer the Mantle upon a <i>Knight-Subject</i>.
Witness King <i>James</i> I. <i>Anno</i> 21. did to <i>James</i> Marquiss
of <i>Hamilton</i>; and King <i>Charles</i> I. <i>Anno</i> 4. to <i>Theophilus</i>,
Earl of <i>Suffolk</i>, and the Year ensuing to <i>William</i>, Earl of
<i>Northampton</i>: And <i>Anno</i> 14. Sir <i>James Palmer</i>, by his
Sovereign’s Direction, paid for the Velvet and Taffety of
the Earl of <i>Kelly</i>’s Mantle and Surcoat, to Sir <i>Peter Richaut</i>,
and put it upon the Account of the extraordinary Expence
of the Order.</p>

<p class='c000'>King <i>Charles</i> II. as a signal Mark of his Favour, caused
seventeen Mantles (with the usual Liveries of Surcoat and
Hood,) to be made ready against the grand Feast of St.
<i>George</i>, <i>Anno</i> 13. which he confered not only among the
new elect Knights, but upon the Earls of <i>Salisbury</i>, <i>Barkshire</i>,
and <i>Northumberland</i>, that were three Senior <i>Knights-Companions</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Collar of the Order, and the great George, the
elect Knight is to provide himself, unless where the Sovereign
is pleased to bestow the Mantle, which is always
accompanied with the Collar, and then a like Warrant
issues to the Master of the <i>Jewel-House</i>, as was used for
providing the seventeen Collars, <i>Anno</i> 13 <i>Car.</i> II.</p>

<p class='c000'>The black Velvet Cap before-mentioned and described,
with the Helm, Crest, and Mantlings, together with a
Sword and Girdle, are to be got in readiness by the care
and direction of the Garter, but at the Expence of the
Knights elect; all which are to be set over his Stall, as
soon as his Installation Fees are paid.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Honour, that every <i>Knight-Companion</i> shall have
his Helm, Crest, and Sword, affixed over his Stall at the
Chappel of St. <i>George</i>, is particularly provided for in all
the several Bodies of Statutes; and are ordained to remain
there during the Lives of the Possessors, <i>In Memory
of him that bears them, and a Testimony of the Defence of
the Church, as the Oaths of Military Orders require</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Helms upon this Occasion are composed of Steel,
and of a more than ordinary proportion; those for Sovereign
Princes are framed open, with large Barrs; but those
for the <i>Knights-Subjects</i> are made close. About King
<span class='pageno' title='311' id='Page_311'></span><i>Henry</i> VIII’s Reign, the <i>Knights-Subjects</i> Helms were
parcel gilt with fine Gold in Oil, wrought with curious
Works, and burnished with fine Gold. But in the Reign
of Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>, and since that Time, it hath been
the Custom to gild their Helms all over, and place the
Arms of St. <i>George</i> in the Middle before the Vizors.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Mantlings that hang down on either side of the
Helm, together with the Wreath, are in some places called
Appendixes, and are all of Tissue, or Cloth of Gold,
and formerly lined with Sarcenet; but in the Reign of
Queen <i>Mary</i> they were exchanged for white Satin, for
so were the Mantlings of <i>Anthony Brown</i>, Viscount <i>Montague</i>,
and <i>William Howard</i>, Lord Admiral, lined.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the bottom of these Mantlings hang a pair of gilt
Knobs burnished with Gold, from which spring out Tossels
either of Gold or Silver, (consentaneous to the Metal
in the Knights Court of Armour) mixed with Silk of the
chief Colour in his Arms.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon the Helm and Mantlings, is placed a Wreath of
corded Silk, of the Knight’s Colours, which was formerly
of Sarcenet, but now of Taffety.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Crest of the Knight is placed either upon these
Wreaths, or Issuant out of a Crown, or Ducal Cap, turned
with Ermin; and of what kind soever the Crest is,
the same is neatly carved in Wood, and either gilt, or
wrought in; Directly before the Helm, an armed Sword
hangs down, the Pomel, Cross, and Chape are gilt; the
Scabbard is made of the same Tissue or Cloth of Gold as
the Mantlings are, as is the Girdle that belongs to it; but
the Buckles and Pendants are of Copper Gilt.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Custom of setting up the Helm, Crest, and Sword,
over the Stall of the Knights, is as ancient as the Institution
of the Order; but when the Banners were first hung
up, we have not so clear a Conviction; for neither the
Statutes of Institution, nor those of <i>Henry</i> V. make mention
of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first time they occur to us, we find to be in <i>Anno</i>
2 <i>Hen.</i> VI. in the black Book of the Order, where the
Banners of the King of <i>Portugal</i> is particularly spoke of,
among the Atchievements then set over the Stall. But
they are more particularly mentioned in the Body of King
<i>Henry</i> VIII’s Statutes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='312' id='Page_312'></span>The Fashion of the Sovereign’s and all the <i>Knights-Companions</i>
Banners are square; yet it does no where appear
what the exact Standard was; yet we find them in
the Reign of Queen <i>Elizabeth</i> to be two Yards and a Quarter
Long, and a Yard and three Quarters Broad, besides
the Fringe, which is composed of Gold, or Silver and Silk,
of the Colours in the Wreath; and on them are wrought,
upon Taffety-Sarcenet, double Sarcenet, or rich Taffety,
with fine Gold Colours on both sides, the Paternal Coat
of the <i>Knights-Companion</i>, together with his Quartering,
or so many of them as he pleases to use, and the Garter
is to take care they be warrantably Marshalled.</p>

<p class='c000'>And because a single Coat was not conceived to stand
fair enough in a Banner of this proportion, the Sovereign
hath been pleased to grant a new Coat, to bear in Quarters
his Paternal one, if he wanted it; as King <i>James</i> I.
did to <i>Robert Carr</i>, Viscount <i>Rochester</i>; to whose Paternal
Coat he first added a Lion Passant, Gardant Or, in
the dexter Part, as an especial Gift of his Favour, and
then invented a new Coat, to be born in Quarter therewith,
<i>viz.</i> Quarterly Or and Gules, a Lyon Rampant
Sable over all, <i>June</i> 8. <i>Anno</i> 9 <i>Jac.</i> I.</p>

<p class='c000'>These Banners of Arms are fixed to the End of long
Staves, painted in Oil, formerly of the Colour of the
Wreaths, but now Red; their Ends are put into Sockets
of Iron, well fixed in the Wall, directly over the <i>Knights-Companions</i>
Helms and Crests, and frequently lined with
Fustian to preserve them.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is moreover to be provided a Copper Plate Gilt,
whereupon are engraved, the Escutcheon of the Knights
elect Arms in Colours Enamilled, with his Quartering,
Helm, Crest, and Supporters, and underneath, his Style
and Titles of Honour, encircled with a Garter. Which
Plate the Garter usually takes Care to provide, and is
to be fixed on the back of the Knights Stall, assigned for
his Installation.</p>

<p class='c000'>A Velvet Cushion is likewise to be provided, to carry
the Knight’s elect Mantle, Collar, Hood, and Book of
Statutes, before him, in the Progress into the Choire, in
order to his Installation. At the Installation of the Lord
Treasurer <i>Weston</i>, and the Earls of <i>Exeter</i> and <i>Lindsey</i>,
who were installed, <i>Anno</i> 6 <i>Car.</i> I. the materials and garnishing
of these Cushions are recited severally, to contain
<span class='pageno' title='313' id='Page_313'></span>one Yard and a Half of Crimson Velvet, one Ell of rich
Taffety for their Lining, four Yards of Fringe, and
four great Tossels.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lastly, There have frequently been made ready a convenient
Number of Lodging Escutcheons of the elect
Knights Arms, invironed with a Garter, and his Stile and
Titles placed underneath; it having been an ancient Custom,
for the Knights to distribute these Escutcheons
at the Inns, in their Passage to, and at <i>Windsor</i>, as a Memorial
of their Installation.</p>

<p class='c000'>What falls under the Care of the Garter to prepare and
make ready, the Expence sometimes has been cast up,
and the Account stated and defraid before-hand; by which
means, he was in a better capacity to furnish out the Ceremony,
for so did the Earls of <i>Shrewsbury</i> and <i>Cumberland</i>,
<i>Anno</i> 34 <i>Eliz.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>Besides these mentioned to be prepared and provided
either by the Chancellor of the Order, or the Garter,
the Knight elect must take care of other Affairs more particularly
relating to himself and his retinue; such as are
Apparel, the Number of his Attendants and Servants,
with their Cloaths and Liveries, his Coach and Saddle
Horses, both for himself and them, with other material
Circumstances, to set off his Cavalcade and Proceeding
with greater Pomp and Gallantry. The Provisions for
Dyet at <i>Windsor</i> (if the Feast be kept at the elect Knight’s
Charge and Expence,) are to be considered of, and very
often some Clark of the Sovereign’s Kitchin is to be consulted,
in the management of that Affair.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Hall or Room where the grand Dinner is to be kept,
as well as the Chapter-House and Chappel, ought chiefly
to be decked and adorned with rich and sumptuous Furniture,
against this Solemnity, over and above what is
commonly used. The Hall or Dining-Room is to be set
off with rich Hangings; and if the Sovereign or his Lieutenant
hold the Feast, there must be placed a Cloth of
State at the upper End of it. The Chapter-House is also
to be hung, and a rich Carpet spread upon the Table,
set about with Velvet Chairs and Cushions; and because
in the late Times of Rebellion and Plunder, this Place
was not exempt, and nothing was found there upon the
Restauration; King <i>Charles</i> II. in a Chapter convened the
1st of <i>January</i>, <i>Anno</i> 14th of his Reign, caused Directions
<span class='pageno' title='314' id='Page_314'></span>to be given to the Master of the Wardrobe, to provide Velvet
for Chairs, to furnish the Chapter-House, and Cushions
to be used in the Choir of St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Chappel</i>, which accordingly
were prepared against the following Feast.</p>

<p class='c000'>Against the Installation of <i>Philip</i>, King of <i>Castile</i> and
<i>Leon</i>, <i>Anno</i> 22 <i>Henry</i> VII. The Table in the Chapter-House
was covered with Cloth of Gold, and the Forms
with Baudkin; before the Sovereign was laid a Cushion
of Cloth of Gold, whereupon a Crucifix lay, and the
Evangelist turned open to a place of the Cannon, with
several Tapers burning on either Side. At the upper End
of the Table, towards the Right Hand, was set a Chair
for the Sovereign, under a golden Canopy, with Cushions
of Cloth of Gold, and on the Left Hand a Stool with like
Embellishments, for the King of <i>Castile</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Chappel</i>, the High Altar is to be richly
adorned with Plate, the Sovereign’s Stall with a Canopy,
and other usual Ornaments, and the Stalls of the <i>Knights-Companions</i>
present at the Ceremony, with Velvet Cushions.
As to the Furnishing of other Places in the Castle
of <i>Windsor</i>, on so solemn an Occasion, we shall relate the
Account of the Ceremony of the Installation of the King of
<i>Leon</i> and <i>Castile</i>, just now mentioned. The Words are
these:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='large'>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch12' class='c005'>CAP. XII.<br /> <br /><i>The Personal Installation of a Knight-Subject.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>§ 1.</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c009'>Formerly
the Knights elect proceeded from
<i>London</i> to their Installation at <i>Windsor</i>, in the
nature of a Solemn and stately Cavalcade,
which was performed on Horse-back, with the greatest
Grandeur, and exceeding Pomp, whether we refer to the
great Number of their Honourable Friends, who, on
gallant Coursers, rode along with them; or the multitude
of their own Attendants well mounted, the magnificence
of whose Apparel, Jewels, Gold Chains, rich Embroideries,
and Plumes of Feathers, of their Lord’s Colours,
struck Amazement, and even dazled the Eyes of the
Spectators.</p>

<p class='c000'>Equivalent to this Pompous Show was the Feast, which
contained in it all manner of Stateliness and Plenty, as
well of Provision, as other Incidents that might increase
its Glory, in which the elect Knights, who kept it at
their own Expence, strove not only to out-vie their
Predecessor, but to Excel one another; That all Embassadors
and Strangers esteemed it one of the goodliest and
noblest Sights, that was to be exhibited in Christendom.</p>

<p class='c000'>But to make the splendor of the Cavalcade no less
conspicuous to the City of <i>London</i>, than to the Town and
Castle of <i>Windsor</i>, the Knights elect have taken up their
Lodgings, sometimes in the <i>Strand</i>, sometimes in <i>Salisbury-Court</i>,
in <i>Holborn</i>, or within the City; and for intent
they chose to pass through some Eminent Streets, that the
People might the better Survey them, and receive the
<span class='pageno' title='316' id='Page_316'></span>greater Satisfaction. To illustrate which Matter, we shall
descend to some Particulars.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Anno</i> 34 <i>Eliz.</i> <i>Gilbert</i>, Earl of <i>Shrewsbury</i>, in order to
his Cavalcade, was lodged in Mr. <i>Gresham</i>’s House, (now
known by the Name of <i>Gresham-College</i>,) whence he Rode
through the City, accompanied with many of his Honourable
Friends, and a numerous and gallant Train of Attendants
and Servants, to <i>Charing-Cross</i>, where he met
<i>George</i>, Earl of <i>Cumberland</i>, (his Companion elect) and
thence both Rode together towards <i>Windsor</i>; within a
Mile or two of which Place, Garter King of Arms met
them, and Marshalled their Attendants in Order; and
then the elect Knights proceeded with their gallant Train
through the Town into the Castle in this Order.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c002'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1. Trumpets, two and two.</div>
      <div class='line'>2. Gentlemen in Blue Coats and Gold Chains.</div>
      <div class='line'>3. Gentlemen of Note.</div>
      <div class='line'>4. Garter.</div>
      <div class='line'>5. Gentlemen Ushers.</div>
      <div class='line'>6. The two elect Knights, Earl of <i>Ormond</i>, and Baron of <i>Effingham</i>; with their Footmen about them.</div>
      <div class='line'>7. Noblemen, Knights, and Gentlemen of Quality.</div>
      <div class='line'>8. All their Servants in the Rear.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Custom and Peace contributed to make the Cavalcades
more glorious, during the Reigns of Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>,
and King <i>James</i> I. and especially that of <i>Robert</i>, Earl of
<i>Salisbury</i>, and <i>Thomas</i>, Viscount <i>Bindon</i>, <i>May</i> 21st, <i>Anno</i>
4 <i>Jac.</i> I. who arrived at <i>Windsor</i> honourably accompanied,
with a great appearance of Nobility, Knights, and
Gentlemen of Figure.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the Fate of this Solemnity, much like that glorious
Body of the Sun, (whose Lustre at such times it strove
to outshine) had now and then its interpositions, and intermitting
Clouds, at other times long Nights, and the
Splendor and Glory thereof but struck the Sight now
and then; when the Pleasure of the Sovereign grew auspicious,
or the Honour of the Order became fixed upon
more generous Spirits. But to speak impartially, there
may grow an Excess in such Solemnities, even to Shame
and Surfeit; and the best Cure to prescribe for it, is a
long Abstinence. Nor was this Festival at all Times free
<span class='pageno' title='317' id='Page_317'></span>from this Distemper, but then a quick Application of the
Sovereign’s soon rectified it by taking away the Cause,
and prohibiting Excess in their Attendants.</p>

<p class='c000'>For this reason it was that King <i>James</i> I. observing
those Excesses the elect Knights run into upon this Occasion,
and willing to cheque the growing Inconveniencies,
at the Installation, of <i>Francis</i>, Earl of <i>Rutland</i>, Sir <i>George
Villars</i>, Kt. (afterwards Duke of <i>Buckingham</i>) and the Viscount
<i>Lisle</i>, <i>Anno</i> 14 of his Reign, <i>forbid Livery Coats,
for saving Charge, and avoiding Emulation</i>; and shortly
after, in a Chapter at <i>White-Hall</i>, <i>Anno</i> 16. with the Consent
of the <i>Knights-Companions</i> then assembled, to put
some restraint upon the Number of Attendants, decreed,
<i>That every of the Knights-Companions should have fifty
Persons to attend him unto the Annual Solemnities of the
Order, and no more</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Installation of <i>William</i>, Earl of <i>Northampton</i>,
<i>Anno</i> 5 <i>Car.</i> I. we find this stinted Number encreased to
fourscore, who began his Cavalcade to <i>Windsor</i>, from
<i>Salisbury</i> House in the <i>Strand</i>, and certainly wou’d have
exhibited a more glorious Show, had not a continual Rain
for three Days space impeded him. Nevertheless, that
what he designed with so much Splendor and Gallantry
might out-live the accident of foul Weather, the Order
of it shall be inserted here.</p>

<p class='c008'>When this Letter was issued out, the Sovereign intended
to create the Prince Knight of the <i>Bath</i>, which
Ceremonies were intended to begin at the old <i>Palace-yard</i>
in <i>Westminster</i>, upon the 21st Day of <i>May</i>, <i>Anno</i> 13 <i>Car.</i> I.
and to Solemnize the Feast of St. <i>George</i>, upon the 23d
of the same Month at <i>White-Hall</i>, and to take the Scrutiny
that Evening for his Election into this Order: The
next Day was designed to invest him with the Garter
and George, and the Day after to set forward the Cavalcade
towards <i>Windsor</i>, wherein also the Knights of the
<i>Bath</i>, (intended to be created with the Prince,) were to
Ride with their Robes. But this Resolution being altered,
stop’d the Progression of the Cavalcade, and in the
room of a Knight of the <i>Bath</i>, he was created a <i>Knight-Batchellor</i>
at <i>Windsor</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Formerly it was the manner for the Sovereign’s Lieutenant
to Ride to <i>Windsor</i>, attended with a gallant and
glittering Train, and no small Number of his own Gentlemen
and Yeomen richly attired, and in every Punctilio
<span class='pageno' title='321' id='Page_321'></span>fifty set out, as was seen in the Cavalcade of the Duke
of <i>Norfolk</i>, Earl Marshal of <i>England</i>, and Lieutenant for
the Sovereign, for St. <i>George</i>’s Feast, <i>Anno</i> 5 <i>Eliz.</i> who
had attending him twenty of his own Gentlemen and
Yeomen, at the Time the Earls of <i>Northumberland</i> and
<i>Warwick</i> were to be installed; but this was never put in
Practice, but when the Sovereign appointed the Installation
and the Feast of St. <i>George</i> to be celebrated together.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Lieutenant, and his Assistants, or sometimes the
<i>Knights-Commissioners</i>, (if the Feast of St. <i>George</i> be not
then Solemnized,) being arrived in the Castle, immediately
retire to their Lodgings, which for the most part
have been prepared at the <i>Dean’s House</i>, whose Rooms
are the fairest in the Castle, and the best fitted for Accommodation,
next to those of the Sovereign’s in the
upper Ward; and for the Knights elect, they were at all
Times furnished with Lodgings in some of the Prebends
Houses.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>The Offering in the Chappel, on the Eve of the Feast.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 2. If it so chanced that the Installation was performed
by Commissioners, and the Cavalcade proceeded from
<i>London</i>, in the Morning of the Day preceeding the Installation,
and arrived at the Castle of <i>Windsor</i> early that
Afternoon; then the <i>Knights-Commissioners</i> have been accustomed
only to put on their Mantles, and enter St.
<i>George</i>’s Chappel to offer; but without the Attendance of
Heralds, or any solemn Procession into the Choir, save
one of the Prebends; where having placed themselves in
their Stalls with usual Reverences, and heard an Anthem,
they passed up to the Altar with the Verger and Garter
before them, and there made their Offering, both of Gold
and Silver, according to the usual Custom. As soon as
<i>Vespers</i> were finished, after the same manner they descended
from their Stalls, and departed to their Lodgings;
and in this case the <i>Knights-Commissioners</i> did not lay by
their Mantles till Supper was ended.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this nature was the Ceremony of Offering (on the
Eve of the Installation) performed by the Lord Admiral
and Earl of <i>Ormond</i>, Commissioners for the Installation
<span class='pageno' title='322' id='Page_322'></span>of the Earl of <i>Shrewsbury</i> and <i>Cumberland</i>, <i>Anno</i> 34
<i>Eliz.</i> But at the Installation of the Earl of <i>Rutland</i>, and
others, <i>Anno</i> 26 <i>Eliz.</i> the Lord <i>Hunsdon</i> (one of the Commissioners
for that Solemnity,) refused to make his Offering
alone, though he arrived timely enough, on the Eve
of the Feast at <i>Windsor</i> Castle, because he wanted the
Company of Viscount <i>Mountague</i>, who was a joynt Commissioner
with him, that arrived not till the Morning
after.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Offering of the <i>Knights-Commissioners</i>, coming to
the Castle on the Eve of the Installation, is founded upon
an Article of <i>Edward</i> III. which runs to this Effect: <i>That
if any of the</i> Knights-Companions, <i>being upon a Journey,
shou’d accidentally pass by</i> Windsor-Castle, <i>he is to turn
in thither, in Honour of the Place, and prepare himself to
enter into the Chappel to Offer; first putting on his Mantle,
without which he must never presume to enter into it</i>; but
upon Emergencies, and allowable Causes, he is to be excused.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the <i>Knight-Companion</i> had entered the Castle,
the Canons Resident were, by the aforesaid Article, appointed
to meet and recieve him, and with due Reverence
conduct him into the Choir. If it was at the
Celebration of High Mass, the Knight was obliged to stay
and hear it, in Honour of God and St. <i>George</i>; but if he
arrived in the Afternoon, he was to stay till the Canons,
and the rest of the Choir, had sung the Anthem <i>de Profundis</i>,
which no sooner was ended, but he proceeded to
the High Altar and Offered, and returned to his Stall
with usual Reverences, and then departed.</p>

<p class='c000'>But if the <i>Knight-Companion</i> passed through the Town
of <i>Windsor</i>, and neglected to Offer at the Chappel, as often
as he omitted it, he was bound, upon his Obedience,
to walk a Mile on Foot to the Chappel, in Honour of
St. <i>George</i>, and upon defailure, to offer a Peny, which
by King <i>Henry</i> VIII’s Statutes is inlarged to a Groat.
Upon the Explication of this Article, there arose a Dispute
about the just Distance intended from the Castle;
and that the Knights-Companions might be sensible of the
breach of the Injunction, it was thought requisite by King
<i>Henry</i> VIII. to set down a certain Bound, which in his
Statutes is declared to be two Miles; within which, if
any of the <i>Knights-Companions</i> come, and do not repair
<span class='pageno' title='323' id='Page_323'></span>to the Chappel and Offer, he is liable to the Mulct before
specified.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon Hunting, or other Pastimes the Forest afforded,
they used to send their Offering in Money to the Canons,
which being received, the Knights took it for a Dispensation
of the Ceremony enjoined by the Statutes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Endeavours were used to have this Article interpreted
with greater Latitude, which so far took Effect, that at
a Chapter called at <i>Windsor</i> the 10th of <i>October</i>, <i>Anno</i>
15 <i>Car.</i> I. it was ordered, that some Expedient might be
found out, to save the Knights from the Breach of their
Oath, if they came within the limited Distance of the
Place, and passed thence without Offering. But no farther
Progress being made in that Affair, the Law stands
as it did.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>The Supper of the Eve.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 3. The Supper, after their arrival at <i>Windsor</i>, is but
in the Nature of a private Meal, and prepared for the
Lieutenant (or Commissioners) or Knights elect, most
commonly at the Dean’s House. <i>Anno</i> 26 <i>Eliz.</i> on the
Eve of the Installation of the Earl of <i>Rutland</i> and Lord
<i>Cobham</i>, the Commissioners supped together with such
Lords and Gentlemen of Figure as came along with
them; and no Nobleman had above one Servant to attend
him at the Table, and the rest provided for themselves
at their proper Inns. Sometimes they have been
permitted to Sup in some Appartments of the Sovereign’s
Lodgings; for so it was at the Installation of the Lord
<i>Russel</i>, and other elect Knights, <i>Anno</i> 31 <i>Henry</i> VIII.
and likewise of the Earl of <i>Shrewsbury</i>, and Lord <i>Hunsdon</i>,
<i>Anno</i> 3 <i>Eliz.</i> the Lieutenant and Knights supped in the
great Chamber there, in the same Regularity that was used
at other Times. And in the 34th of Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>,
when the Earls of <i>Shrewsbury</i> and <i>Cumberland</i> were installed,
all the Lords and Gentlemen supped together
at one long Table set in the Council Chamber.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' title='324' id='Page_324'></span>
<h3 class='c010'><i>The Order in proceeding to the Chapter-House.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>§ 4. Before we come to the particular Ceremonies of
the Installation, transacted either by the Sovereign, (or
in his absence by his Lieutenant or Commissioners,) we
shall premise this general Remark: That since neither
the Statutes of <i>Institution</i>, nor those of King <i>Henry</i> V.
afford us a Formulary for the Personal Installation of a
Knight elect; yet those enacted by King <i>Henry</i> VIII.
do briefly exhibit the Order and Method of it. And we
must farther observe, that if the Installation be appointed
together with the Feast of St. <i>George</i>, then either the Sovereign,
or else his Lieutenant and Assistants are present;
but if at any other Season, then it passeth by Commissioners
only.</p>

<p class='c000'>After such time therefore as the Sovereign, his Lieutenant,
or Commissioners, have prefixed the Hour wherein
to proceed to the Chapter House, in Order to the Installation,
(which has generally been dispatched in the Evening,)
all the <i>Knights-Companions</i>, and elect Knights, the
Officers of the Order, and of Arms, the Prebends of the
College, and Alms-Knights, are to give their Attendance,
<i>viz.</i> the Knights-Companions, and elect Knights, and
Officers, of the Order, on the Sovereign, in his inward
Lodging; the elect Knights, and Officers of Arms, in the
Presence Chamber, the Prebends and Alms-Knights, in the
Great Chamber, where they waited the Sovereign’s coming
forth.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Attendance to be given upon the Sovereign’s Lieutenant,
and such of the Knights-Companions as are appointed
for his Assistants, is by the Officers of the Order and
of Arms, the Prebends and Alms-Knights, either at his
Lodgings, or elsewhere he shall deem meet to appoint;
from which the Knights-Companions are exempt. For
though the Knights-Companions have sometimes proceeded
to the Chappel before the Sovereign’s Lieutenant,
at an Installation, yet hath it been at such time only, as
they accompanied their Sovereign to <i>Windsor</i>, to hold the
Feast of St. <i>George</i>; and if the Sovereign, through any Indisposition,
or weighty Affair, cou’d not pass down to the
Chappel on the Eve of the Feast, yet they being obliged
<span class='pageno' title='325' id='Page_325'></span>by the Statutes to celebrate <i>Vespers</i>, did upon this Occasion
proceed thither, though not upon the Account of
Installation; as it fell out at the Installation of Prince
<i>Henry</i>, and four other Knights, <i>Anno</i> 1 <i>Jac.</i> I. when the
Progression began from the Presence Chamber, and thence
passed to the Chappel in the following Order.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c002'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1. Alms-Knights.</div>

      <div class='line'>11. Register.</div>
      <div class='line'>12. Black Rod.</div>
      <div class='line'>13. Chancellor.</div>
      <div class='line'>14. The Sovereign’s Lieutenant leading the Prince in his Hand.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>At the Installation of the Duke of <i>Brunswick</i>, and five
other elect Knights, the 23d of <i>November</i>, <i>Anno</i> 1 <i>Car.</i> I.
the Knights-Companions likewise proceeded before the
Sovereign’s Lieutenants, tho’ the Sovereign was at <i>Windsor</i>,
but not in the Cavalcade.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon the Sovereign’s Commissioners, neither the
Knights-Companions, nor the Prelate, nor Chancellor, do
give their Attendance; only at the Grand Feast of St.
<i>George</i>, <i>Anno</i> 13 <i>Car.</i> II. the Chancellor then waiting on
the Sovereign at <i>Windsor</i>, in the Duties of his Place, out of
a singular Regard to his Royal Highness the Duke of
<i>York</i>, attending the Commissioners in the proceeding to
his Installation, for at that time he was Comptroller of his
Houshould.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Proceedings on this solemn Occasion have been
generally order’d on Foot; yet upon extraordinary Incidents
have been marshalled and disposed on Horse-back,
in manner of a Cavalcade, as was used at the Installation
of <i>Philip</i> King of <i>Castile</i>, <i>Anno</i> 22 <i>Hen.</i> VII. and that
when the Lord <i>Russel</i> and other elect Knights were installed,
<span class='pageno' title='326' id='Page_326'></span><i>Anno</i> 31 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. King <i>Philip</i> (when the Earl of
<i>Sussex</i> was installed, <i>Anno</i> 1 and 2. <i>Ph.</i> and <i>Mar.</i>) honoured
him with his Presence, and riding on Horse-back, with
several of the Knights-Companions, from his Lodgings
in the Castle, down to the Cloister Door, at the East-End
of the Chappel, and there alighting, proceeded directly
to the Chapter-House. The Proceeding was on Horse-back,
at the Installation of the Earl of <i>Shrewsbury</i> and the
Lord <i>Hunsdon</i>, <i>Anno</i> 3 <i>Eliz.</i> and at the Earl of <i>Northumberland</i>’s
and Earl of <i>Warwick</i>’s, <i>Anno</i> 5. At the Installation
of <i>Francis</i>, Duke <i>Montmorency</i>, the Viscount <i>Hereford</i>,
and the Lords <i>Burleigh</i>, <i>Grey</i>, and <i>Shandos</i>, <i>Anno</i> 14
<i>Eliz.</i> The Sovereign’s Lieutenant and Knights Assistants
did Robe themselves in the Sovereign’s Lodging in the
Castle; and meeting in the Presence Chamber, proceeded
downwards towards the outer Hall-door, in the upper
Ward of the Castle, when taking their Horses, adorned
with Foot Clothes, they proceeded on Horse-back to the
West Door of the Chappel.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the Progression was begun on Horse-back at the beginning
of the Feast, so it continued, as often as the Sovereign
(his Lieutenant or Commissioner) went to the Chapter-House,
or Chappel, and their returns were marshalled
in the like Order at their setting out.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Servants and Attendants belonging to the Knights
elect, (if they be taken into the Procession,) pass on first
two and two in a Rank, according to their Quality; and
those who are the most inferior, the foremost: Next the
Alms-Knights in their Habits and usual Order.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then follows the Virger of the College.</p>

<p class='c000'>After him the Prebends or Canons: But what attendance
they have given heretofore at the Installations, the
Memoirs of this illustrious Society is wholly silent in; for
in those Schemes left us of proceeding to Installations, in
the Reigns of King <i>Henry</i> VIII. King <i>Edward</i> VI. Queen
<i>Mary</i>, and part of Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>, we find them not
inserted, though since they are next to the Prebends of the
College, the Pursuivants, Heralds, and Provincial Kings
of Arms, proceed in a Body.</p>

<p class='c000'>After them the Knights-Subjects elect, unless the Proctor
of an absent Knight-Subject, pass at the same time in
this Proceeding, who take Place after the Provincial Kings:
And if it so chance, that the Proctor to a Stranger-Prince
<span class='pageno' title='327' id='Page_327'></span>be present at the same time, he is to proceed between
the Knight-Subject’s Proctor, and the Knights-Subject
elect. But Prince <i>Henry</i> at his Installation, <i>Anno</i> 1 <i>Jac.</i> I.
moved in a Place Superior to all the Knights-Companions,
and was paired with the Earl of <i>Nottingham</i>, the Sovereign’s
Lieutenant for that Occasion. Where two or more
elect Knights prepare for their Installation at the same
time, they take Place according to the Seniority of their
Election, going two and two together; and if the Number
be odd, the Junior elect Knight passeth alone. Formerly
the elect Knight passed in his ordinary Apparel,
wearing over it in Days of Yore a short Gown, afterwards
a Cloak, and of latter Times a Coat, as did the
Earl of <i>Northumberland</i>, <i>Anno</i> 5 <i>Eliz.</i> and the Earls of
<i>Pembrook</i> and <i>Derby</i>, <i>Anno</i> 16 <i>Eliz.</i> and the Annals of the
Order make this remark upon the Earl of <i>Sussex</i>, and the
Lord <i>Buckhurst</i>, <i>Anno</i> 31 of <i>Eliz.</i> of <i>Charles</i> Duke of <i>York</i>,
<i>An.</i> 9 <i>Jac.</i> I. But this was before any peculiar under Habit,
was appointed to the Knights-Companions, for now there
being a Cloth of Silver Doublet, and Trunk Hose, established
to be worn at the Feast of Installation, and of St.
<i>George</i>, the elect Knight proceeds in this Dress, as did
the Duke of <i>Albermarle</i>, <i>Anno</i> 23 <i>Car.</i> II.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this proceeding to the Chapter-House, he wears only
the Garter about his Leg, and the George and the Ribbond
wherewith he was invested, either about his Neck,
or as of late drawn under his right Arm, which being
omitted by Sir <i>George Villars</i>, and Viscount <i>Lisle</i>, is noted
to be contrary to order.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Earl of <i>Rutland</i> with his Fellow elect Knights,
<i>Anno</i> 14 <i>Jac.</i> I. proceeded Bare-headed, as did the Duke
of <i>Lenox</i>, <i>Anno</i> 9 <i>Car.</i> I. as well as the Duke of <i>Albermarle</i>,
<i>Anno</i> 23 <i>Car.</i> II.</p>

<p class='c000'>The elect Knight does not always make one in this
Proceeding, but sometimes stays at his Lodgings in the
Castle, as did the Earls of <i>Shrewsbury</i> and <i>Cumberland</i>,
<i>Anno</i> 34 <i>Eliz.</i> or else at some other convenient Station
adjoining to the Chapter-House, till he be sent for in thither,
to receive Investiture with the Surcoat, as the Duke
of <i>Montmorency</i> did, and other elect Knights, <i>Anno</i> 14
<i>Eliz.</i> who went privately from the Sovereign’s Lodgings,
down to the House of Mr. <i>French</i>, (then one of the Prebends,)
and rested in the Parlour, until they were sent
<span class='pageno' title='328' id='Page_328'></span>for: Sometimes the Knight elect goes privately into the
East-Isle of the Chappel behind the High Altar, and there
remains till called in, as did the Duke of <i>Monmouth</i>, <i>Anno</i>
15 <i>Car.</i> II.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the Sovereign be present at the Installation, the
Knights-Companions proceed next after the Knights elect,
according to the order of their Stalls; but if the Sovereign’s
Lieutenant, then his Assistants go in their Places; as at the
Installation of the Earl of <i>Shrewsbury</i> and Lord <i>Hunsdon</i>,
<i>Anno</i> 3 <i>Eliz.</i> makes plain, the proceeding being ordered
after this manner.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c002'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1. Vergers.</div>
      <div class='line'>2. Alms-Knights.</div>
      <div class='line'>3. Officers of Arms.</div>
      <div class='line'>4. Elect-Knights.</div>
      <div class='line'>5. Assistants to the Lieutenants.</div>
      <div class='line'>6· Officers of the Order.</div>
      <div class='line'>7. Earl of <i>Arundel</i>, Lieutenant.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>If the Installation be dispatched by Commissioners,
then the three inferior Officers of the Order immediately
follow the Knight elect, and proceed next before the
Commissioners, and they were thus marshalled at the
Installation of the Earl of <i>Northampton</i>, <i>Anno</i> 5 <i>Car.</i> I.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c002'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1. The Earls Servants.</div>
      <div class='line'>2. Alms-Knights.</div>
      <div class='line'>3. Prebends.</div>
      <div class='line'>4. Heralds.</div>
      <div class='line'>5. Elect-Knights.</div>
      <div class='line'>6. Officers of the Order.</div>
      <div class='line'>7. The Sovereign’s Commissioners.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Yet <i>Anno</i> 16 <i>Eliz.</i> at the Installation of the Earls of
<i>Pembrook</i> and <i>Derby</i>, we find the Officers did precede the
elect Knights, but it was through inadvertency; at the
Installation of the Earl of <i>Northampton</i>, some Question
and Debate arose, concerning the precedency of these
three Officers, in this proceeding, where it was at length
concluded, that from the Castle to the Chappel, they
shou’d proceed before the Commissioners; but in returning
from the Chappel to the Castle, they shou’d follow.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='329' id='Page_329'></span>We presume the Question, (whatsoever it was) chanced
not to be propounded, till the proceeding was ready to
pass on, and then started on a sudden, because the Heralds
(as the Annals note,) did not quickly discypher the matter,
that it proceeded more from surprize, than want of
Ability to resolve.</p>

<p class='c000'>This determination which took Place, was barely
grounded upon Conjecture, and if seriously considered,
will appear disconsonant to Precedents and Practice, both
before and since; where all returns are marshalled answerable
to their setting forth, unless the Condition of
any Person in the mean time suffer a Mutation.</p>

<p class='c000'>It’s observable, that when Installation pass by Commissioners
only, these three inferior Officers wear their
Robes, but bear not the Ensigns of their Office in the
Proceeding. And this seems to be deduced from particular
Injunctions, laid down in the Constitutions belonging
to the Officers of the Order, which appoint Garter
and Black-Rod to bear the Ensigns of their Offices
at the Feast of St. <i>George</i>, when the Sovereign or his Deputy
shall be present; whence it may be inferred, that if
either chance to be absent, they are under no obligation
to bear them: For at the Installations of <i>Frederick</i>, King
of <i>Denmark</i>, and <i>John Casimire</i>, Count Palatine of the
<i>Rhine</i>, <i>Anno</i> 25 <i>Eliz.</i> no Ensigns were born by the Officers;
and so was it practised the Year after, at the Installations
of the Earl of <i>Rutland</i> and Lord <i>Cobham</i>, as the
Red-Book of Order plainly sets forth. But if the Sovereign
himself be present, or that he constitute a Lieutenant
in his stead, the Register then carries the Red-Book,
and the Garter and the Black-Rod bear each of them their
Rods. It is remarkable, that in every proceeding to Installation,
by Lieutenant, or Commissioners, the Garter
carries the Sovereign’s Commission in his Hand before
them to the Chapter-House. At the Installation of the
Earls of <i>Derby</i> and <i>Moreton</i>, the Officers of the Order
proceeded before the Knights to the Chapter-House, not
only without the Ensigns of their Office, but their Heads
covered; and the reporter of this Installation gives this
for a reason; because there was then neither the Sovereign,
nor his Lieutenant, representing the King’s Person,
present.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='330' id='Page_330'></span>The Sovereign sometimes being willing to confer additional
Honours to some elect Knights, hath appointed
their Installation at such time as he personally solemnized
the Feast of St. <i>George</i>, as he did at the Installation
and Election of <i>Philip</i> King of <i>Castile</i>, <i>Anno</i> 22
<i>Hen.</i> VII. which for its memorableness, and mixt proceeding
on Horse-back, we shall insert in this Place: He
passed from the Sovereign’s Lodging in the Castle, to
the South-Door of St. <i>George</i>’s-<i>Chappel</i>, and was thus
ordered.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c002'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1. Knights according to their Degrees.</div>
      <div class='line'>2. Lords after their Degrees.</div>
      <div class='line'>3. Knights-Companions in their whole Habit, bearing Company with some of the Knights of the Order of <i>Joyson d’Or</i>.</div>
      <div class='line'>4. Prelate of the Order.</div>
      <div class='line'>5. Archbishop of <i>Canterbury</i>.</div>
      <div class='line'>6. The <i>Spanish</i> Ambassador.</div>
      <div class='line'>7. <i>Joyson d’Or</i>, King of Arms, in Coat of Arms.</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><i>Anno</i> 19 <i>Jac.</i> I. was another instance at the Feast of
St. <i>George</i>, when the Sovereign, with several Knights-Companions,
proceeded also to the Chapel, at the personal
Installation of <i>Frederick</i>, Prince Palatine of the <i>Rhine</i>;
we might add several other Examples, but shall only
mention that of the personal appearance of King <i>Charles</i> II.
at the grand Feast of St. <i>George</i>, held next after his happy
Restoration, whereat twelve elect Knights were installed.
At this Solemnity of Installation, the Sovereign
proceeds in full Robes, having the Sword of State born
before him by a Nobleman not of the Order, his Train-bearers,
<i>&amp;c.</i> following the Sovereign’s Lieutenant and his
Assistants, as also the Commissioners proceed in full Robes,
which is mention’d, <i>Anno</i> 31 <i>Henry</i> VIII. when the Earl
of <i>Arundel</i> and his Assistants installed the Lord <i>Russel</i> and
two other elect Knights, but the Sovereign’s Lieutenant
<span class='pageno' title='331' id='Page_331'></span>only hath his Train carried up, which is usually perform’d
by some of his own Gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Processional way (if beginning in the Presence-Chamber,)
is from thence in the upper Ward of the Castle,
and through the other Wards in at the Cloyster Door, and
so to the Chapter-House; but if from the Dean’s House,
they go only through the Cloysters, into which there is an
immediate Passage from the Deanry: The proceeding
having entred the East Door of St. <i>George</i>’s Chapel, and
past by the Chapter-House Door, makes a stand in the
North Isle; while first the Officers of the Order, next the
Knights-Commissioners, or else the Knights-Assistants,
and the Sovereign’s Lieutenant; or lastly the Knights-Companions,
and the Sovereign with the Sword born before
him, pass into the Chapter-House, but the Knight
or Knights elect do not enter, but as they come in at the
Chapel-Door, they fall off on the left Hand into the East
Isle behind the high Altar, and there repose themselves,
(on Chairs or Stools, with Cushions purposely prepared,)
until they are called into the Chapter-House. This hath
generally been the Custom, of which many Examples might
be produced, but in respect to great Personages they have
been sometimes (though rarely) admitted into the Chapter-House,
with the Sovereign or his Lieutenant, among
whom <i>Philip</i> of <i>Castile</i> and <i>Leon</i>, <i>Anno</i> 22 <i>Henry</i> VII.
and Prince <i>Henry</i>, <i>Anno</i> 1 <i>Jac.</i> I. the latter was led in by
the Sovereign’s Lieutenant, when four other elect Knights
installed with him sat till they receiv’d their Summons
to enter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sometime the Sovereign and Knights-Companions wav’d
going to the Chapter-House, and pass’d immediately into
the Choir, as did King <i>James</i> <i>Anno</i> 9. when <i>Charles</i>
Duke of <i>York</i> and others were installed; the like did King
<i>Charles</i> I. but then a Chapter was held in the Privy-Chamber,
before the proceeding set forward; and in the
former instance, when the proceeding came as far as the
East End of the Chapel, the Duke of <i>York</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> with
<i>Norroy</i> before them, went out of the proceeding into the
Chapter-House, and there reposed, while the Sovereign
proceeded on to the South Door of the Chapel, and thence
into the Choir.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' title='332' id='Page_332'></span>
<h3 class='c010'><i>The Ceremonies perform’d in the Chapter-House.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>§ 5. After the Lieutenant’s entrance into the Chapter-House,
and opening the Chapter; Garter, with three
Reverences, presents first the Commissioners of Lieutenancy
to hold the Feast, next that of Installation, to the
Lieutenant, (or if the Installation pass’d by Commissioners,
then only the Commission of Installation to the Senior
Commissioner,) which being receiv’d, he delivers it to the
Register of the Order, who forthwith Reads it; for to
him this Duty belongs, as is recorded in the Black-Book
of the Order, on occasion of Garter’s reading the Commission
for Installation of Sir <i>Thomas Brandon</i>, <i>Anno</i> 22
<i>Henry</i> VII. the Register being then absent.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Register hath read the Commissions, he returns
them to the Lieutenant, (or Commissioners,) and he
again to the Garter, as at the Installation of the Earls of
<i>Shrewsbury</i> and <i>Cumberland</i>, <i>Anno</i> 34 <i>Eliz.</i> If the Sovereign
be present, the Chancellor acquaints him the Knights
elect are without, otherwise the Lieutenant, and Assistants,
(or Commissioners) consult touching the calling in,
and receiving them, and Garter is usually employed in this
Service; who, with all due respect, compliments and conducts
him to the Chapter-House Door: But in the instance
of the Earls of <i>Shrewsbury</i> and <i>Cumberland</i> aforesaid,
Garter went to their Lodgings, and having delivered his
Message, they forthwith repaired to the Chapter-House,
their Train attending them to the Door: At the Installation
of <i>Francis</i> Duke of <i>Montmorency</i>, the Earl of <i>Leicester</i>,
then the Sovereign’s Lieutenant, as an evidence of
singular respect, sent from the Chapter two of the four
Assistants assigned him, who taking Garter, and the Officers
of Arms before them, led him thence between them
to the Chapter-House.</p>

<p class='c000'>When there are two or more elect Knights, that wait
in the East Isle, expecting to be called in, Garter first conducts
the Senior by Election to the Chapter-House Door,
and so the rest in their several Orders, as in 14 <i>Jac.</i> I.
by the Earl of <i>Rutland</i>, Sir <i>George Villars</i>, and the Viscount
<i>Lisle</i>; and so again 13 <i>Car.</i> II. As soon as Garter
hath conducted the elect Knight to the Chapter-House
<span class='pageno' title='333' id='Page_333'></span>Door, two of the Commissioners, (when the Installation
is performed by Commissioners,) or two of the Knights-Assistants,
(when by the Sovereign’s Lieutenant,) or two
of the Senior Knights, (if the Sovereign himself be present,)
receive him without, who is immediately conducted
from the Chapter-House Door, up to the Sovereign, (his
Lieutenant, or Commissioners,) to whom he makes humble
Reverence; when the Lieutenant, (or Senior Commissioners,)
in a short Speech, publishes the effect of his
Commission, and declares to him the Sovereign’s bounty
and ready kindness, in a full admittance into this Honourable
Society, which the elect Knight very humbly acknowledges
and accepts. When <i>Philip</i> King of <i>Castile</i>
and <i>Leon</i> was installed in Person, <i>Anno</i> 22 <i>Henry</i> VII.
the Sovereign being present rose from his Throne, and
gave him Information of the Statutes and Ceremonies of
the Order, and how he was bound by them; to all which
he freely and readily assented.</p>

<p class='c000'>These Ceremonies of receiving an elect Knight being
over, he disrobes himself of his upper Garment, then the
Surcoat and Kirtle is taken from the Table, with which
he is invested; and during this Ceremony, the following
Words of Admonition, entred at the end of King <i>Hen.</i> VIII’s
Book of English Statutes, are read or spoken.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Take this Robe of Purple, to the encrease of your Honour,
and in Token, or Sign, of the most Honourable Order you have
receiv’d; wherewith you being defended, may be bold not only
strong to Fight, but also to offer your self to shed your Blood
for Christ’s Faith, the Liberties of the Church, and the just
and necessary defence of them that are oppressed and needy.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>After this, his Sword is close girt about him over his
Surcoat, by the Commissioners, (or the Assistants to the
Lieutenant, or some of the Knights-Companions,) and
sometimes in the way of assistance, Garter hath done this
Service; and as soon as the Ceremony is over, the Sovereign,
or his Lieutenant, proceeds into the Choir, leaving
the elect Knights behind them: The Hood was heretofore
put on in the Chapter-House, (for so the Statutes of
King <i>Henry</i> VIII. do appoint,) after the elect Knight
hath been invested with his Surcoat, and before he proceeded
to his Installation; but of late, because it must be
<span class='pageno' title='334' id='Page_334'></span>taken off again in the Choir, and laid aside, that the
Mantle may be put on, it hath been esteemed a sort of diminution
in the Investiture to take off any part of the Habit
before the whole Investiture be compleated; so that in
the beginning of the Reign of King <i>James</i> I. it was judged
more convenient that the Hood should be carried on the
Cushion by Garter into the Choir, together with the Mantle
and Collar, and not be put on till after Investiture with
the Mantle; and thus it was observed at the Feasts of
St. <i>George</i>, 13, 15, and 23 <i>Car.</i> II. And though antiently
it was laid over the left Shoulder, and so worn upon
all Occasions, yet <i>Anno</i> 2 and 3 <i>Phil.</i> and <i>Mar.</i> the wearing
it so being taken notice of to obscure the Escutcheon
of St. <i>George</i>, embroidered on the same Shoulder of the
Mantle, it was decreed in a Chapter held the same Year,
22 of <i>April</i>, that for the future the Knights-Companions
should wear their Hoods on their right Shoulders, to the
end that the Escutcheon might be the better seen and appear.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nevertheless, there was a Question moved 12 <i>Jac.</i> I.
whether the usage of wearing the Hood should not be restored
to the left Shoulder, but it seems it was over-ruled;
and 23 <i>Car.</i> II. some of the Knights-Companions imagining
it most proper to wear their Hoods on their left
Shoulders, ran into that error, but upon better information
the next Morning, altered them to the right. To
Foreign Princes, there is liberty given by King <i>Hen.</i> VIII’s
Statutes to receive, if they please, their Habit wholly
within the Chapter-House, before they enter their Stalls;
by which it appears that this was the Custom in times past;
an instance whereof we have in <i>Philip</i> King of <i>Castile</i>,
<i>Anno</i> 22 <i>Henry</i> VII. who was entirely invested in the
Chapter-House with the Garter, Surcoat, Mantle, Hood,
and Collar; the Sovereign himself putting his Hand to
his Investiture with the Mantle. Hence King <i>Philip</i>,
Grandson to the aforesaid King of <i>Castile</i>, was invested
with the whole Habit of the Order before he assumed the
Stall; in <i>Philip</i> and <i>Mary</i>’s proceeding to the Chapel, he
receiv’d his Investiture within the West Door, and there
the Register delivered the Mantle to the Earls of <i>Derby</i>
and <i>Pembrook</i>, who kissing it, presented it to the Queen,
who, assisted by the said Earls, personally invested the
King therewith: Next Garter gave the Collar to the
<span class='pageno' title='335' id='Page_335'></span>Earls of <i>Arundel</i> and <i>Pembrook</i>, who likewise presented it
to the Queen, and she thereon put it about King <i>Philip</i>’s
Neck; and immediately the Knights-Companions, having
robed themselves within the Chapel Door, proceeded
before the King and Queen, who with joined Hands passed
into the Choir, where the Queen led him to the Sovereign’s
Stall, which ascending, they both sat therein.
But as the aforesaid Statute leaves this to the pleasure of
the Stranger Prince, and was permitted only for gaining
Time, so none, who have receiv’d personal Installation at
<i>Windsor</i> since, have been fully invested before they entered
the Choir. For instance, <i>Francis</i>, Duke <i>de Montmorency</i>,
14 <i>Eliz.</i> and <i>Frederick</i>, Prince Palatine of the <i>Rhine</i>, 10
<i>Jac.</i> I. were both invested with their Surcoats only in the
Chapter-House, but they receiv’d their Mantles, Hoods,
and Collars, in their Stalls, after they had taken their
Oaths.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>The proceeding into the Choir.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 6. The Knight elect, habited as before, proceeds
from the Chapter-House along the North Isle, and enters
the West Door of the Choir in solemn Order; but his
Place in this proceeding is changed, for here he is led between
two Knights-Companions. This is noted in the
Black-Book to be the Order wherein <i>Albra Vasques d’Almadea</i>,
Earl of <i>Averence</i>, and two others, proceeded to
their Installations, 24 <i>Henry</i> VI. And notwithstanding the
Statutes of Institution, and those made by King <i>Henry</i> V.
are silent in the Order of this Proceeding; yet for an elect
Knight to be led to his Stall between two fellow Knights,
is no modern Ceremony; since we likewise find, that the
Viscount <i>Bourchier</i>, 30 <i>Henry</i> VI. past to his Instalment
between the Lord <i>Hastings</i> and Lord <i>Beauchamp</i>. But
the Order of proceeding is precisely set down in
<i>Henry</i> VIII’s Statutes, <i>viz.</i> <i>That the elect Knight, attended
by his Gentlemen and Servants, shall be led between
two other Knights-Companions, the Officers of the Order
going before them</i>. And this has been the constant Practice
at all Installations since; the Knight elect proceeding,
either between two of the Knights-Commissioners, when
there hath been no Lieutenant, or between two of the
<span class='pageno' title='336' id='Page_336'></span>Knights Assistants, where a Lieutenant was constituted;
or lastly between the two Senior Knights-Companions,
the Sovereign being present: But when there hath been
three Commissioners named, then the two Senior Commissioners
take the Knight elect between them, and the
Junior Knight-Commissioner proceeds before them;
which was observed at the Instalment of the Earls of
<i>Essex</i> and <i>Ormond</i>, and Sir <i>Christopher Hatton</i>, 30 <i>Eliz.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>In all cases where the Sovereign is present at an Installation,
after the custom of investing with the Collar in
the Chapter-House was left off, it is generally to be observed,
that as soon as the Investiture with the Surcoat is
finished, the Sovereign passes from the Chapter-House
into the Choir, with the whole proceeding before him,
leaving the elect Knight behind; and when he and the
Knights-Companions have taken their Stalls, the two
Senior Knights-Companions, by the Sovereign’s verbal
Directions, descend from their Stalls, and stand under
their Banners, whilst the Alms-Knights, but not the Prebends,
Officers of Arms, and the three inferior Officers of
the Order, pass out of the Choir, and proceed before
them to the Chapter-House, from whence they introduce
the elect Knight into the Choir to his Installation; but
if there be more than one Knight installed, then the two
next Senior Knights descend, and so the next, till all the
elect Knights are Conducted in: And this course is likewise
observed when a Lieutenant is constituted, and hath
been generally so practised since the Investiture with the
Collar was performed in the Choir; and particularly at
the Installations of the Duke of <i>Lenox</i>, the Earls of <i>Pembrook</i>,
<i>Marr</i>, and <i>Southampton</i>, 1 <i>Jac.</i> I. and of the Duke
of <i>Holstein</i>, and the Earl of <i>Northampton</i>, 3 <i>Jac.</i> I. In this
proceeding to Installation, the Register usually carries a
Book of the New Testament, for the elect Knight to take
his Oath on, as likewise the Oath it self, fairly written
on Parchment: Garter bears his Mantle till he arrives at
his Stall; and King <i>Henry</i> VIII’s Statutes place this Service
upon some of the Knights-Companions likewise;
but it never appears that it was ever performed by any of
them. ’Tis probable, that about the time when this Injunction
passed, it was the Custom for Garter to bear the
Mantle on his Arm; for so it was at the Installation of
the Lord <i>Russel</i>, and others, 31 <i>Henry</i> VIII. but it was
<span class='pageno' title='337' id='Page_337'></span>not long after, that the laying it on a Velvet Cushion began.
The great Collar of the Order was likewise laid
upon the Cushion, at the Installation of Sir <i>Henry Sidney</i>,
6 <i>Eliz.</i> the Earl of <i>Shrewsbury</i>, 34 <i>Eliz.</i> and in this manner
born before the Knights elect, 13 <i>Car.</i> II. before the
Duke of <i>Monmouth</i>, 15 <i>Car.</i> II. and before the Duke of
<i>Albermarle</i>, 23 <i>Car.</i> II. with these the Hood, heretofore
put on in the Chapter-House, hath of late been laid on
the Cushion, and also the Book of Statutes, and so born
by Garter before Prince <i>Henry</i>, 1 <i>Jac.</i> I. and <i>Frederick</i>,
Elector Palatine, 10 <i>Jac.</i> I. and before the Knights Installation,
13 <i>Car.</i> II. and since.</p>

<p class='c000'>And here it is to be observed, that when Garter bears
the Ornaments and Ensigns on the Cushion before an
elect Knight, or a Proctor, he is always placed between
the Register and Black-Rod in the proceeding: Lastly, in
this proceeding the Knight elect goeth Bare-headed, holding
his Cap in his Hand; and so did the Duke of <i>Albermarle</i>,
23 <i>Car.</i> II. for it hath been thought incongruous
to the Order of Investiture, as is before observed of the
Hood, to put on any part of the Habit, or other Ornaments,
that must be taken off again, before the Investiture
is compleated; and the proper Place for putting on the
Cap is not till all the other is finished.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>The Ceremonies of Installation.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 7. When the proceeding hath entered the Choir,
the Alms-Knights, and Officers of Arms, make their
Obeysances toward the High Altar, and the Sovereign’s
Royal Stall, in the manner hereafter described; then they
proceed to the Steps before the Altar, and divide themselves;
next the Officers of the Order make the same
Reverence; and lastly, the two Commissioners, or Knights
Assistants, or Knights-Companions, and Knights-elect,
all three together. After this the Officers of the Order
turn aside toward the Stall designed for the elect Knight,
and approaching near it, stand below in the Choir, whilst
the Commissioners, or Assistants, or Knights-Companions,
pass into the lower Row of Stalls, sometimes called the
middle Row, directly under the designed Stall, leading
the elect Knight with them, who in this Place takes his
<span class='pageno' title='338' id='Page_338'></span>Oath, called in the Annals, the sacred Oath of the Order
of the Garter; during which time he ought to stand between
the two Knights-Companions who brought him
thither, as at the Installation of Prince <i>Henry</i>, 1 <i>Jac.</i> I.
and when the Earl of <i>Shrewsbury</i> was installed, 34 <i>Eliz.</i>
’tis observed, that the Senior Commissioner first entered the
lower row of Stalls; but 31 <i>Henry</i> VIII. at the Installation
of the Lord <i>Russel</i>, and others, the Junior Assistant
went up first. The Knight elect being thus placed, the
Register of the Order standing before them, but below
in the Choir, reads the Oath; for it is part of his Duty
to administer the same: And in this solemn Ceremony,
the New Testament, whereon the Oath is taken, generally
opened in some Place of the Gospels, is indifferently
held by one of the three inferior Officers of the Order,
or sometimes the Register hath held it, as at the Installation
of the Earl of <i>Derby</i>, 16 <i>Eliz.</i> the Earl of <i>Rutland</i>,
and Lord <i>Cobham</i>, 26 <i>Eliz.</i> At other times the Garter
hath held it, as 5 <i>Eliz.</i> when the Earl of <i>Northumberland</i>
took his Oath; and 10 <i>Car.</i> I. at the Installation of the
Earl of <i>Moreton</i>: But when the Earl of <i>Shrewsbury</i> was
Sworn, 34 <i>Eliz.</i> the Usher of the Black Rod performed
this Office.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whilst the Oath is administring, the elect Knight holds
his right Hand on the Holy Evangelists; and when the
Register hath pronounced the Words, he immediately
Responses, <i>I will, so help me God</i>, and then takes off his
Hand reverently, kissing the Book; and by this Ceremony
seals his Obligation to the Statutes of this most Noble
Order. The Ceremony used when <i>Philip</i>, King of <i>Castile</i>
and <i>Leon</i>, took the Oath, which was done in the
Chapter-House at <i>Windsor</i>, 22 <i>Henry</i> VII. he laid his
Hand on the Canon, under which was placed the Book
of Statutes of the Order by the Prelate, to whom it was
delivered by the Register, and having repeated the Words
of the Oath, and reverently kissed all those things by
which he Swore, he took a Pen from the Prelate’s Hand,
and Signed the Oath he had taken, and deliver’d it to the
Sovereign then present.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Form of the ancient Oath appointed by the Statutes
of Institution, to be taken by a Knight-Subject, was
very short, but comprehensive: <i>That he should well
and faithfully observe, to the utmost of his Power, all the
<span class='pageno' title='339' id='Page_339'></span>Statutes of the Order</i>; and this was all the Oath taken by
the first Founders, and to which they also affixed their
Seals; and so it continued without alteration or addition,
till towards the End of King <i>Edward</i> IV’s Reign; and
then, at a Chapter held at the King’s Wardrobe in <i>London</i>,
it was decreed, That all the Knights-Companions then
alive, and all such as should afterwards be admitted into
the Order, should be obliged to subjoin the Words following:
<i>That they wou’d aid, support, and defend, with all
their Power</i>, the Royal College of St. <i>George</i>, within the
Castle of <i>Windsor</i>, <i>as well in its Possessions, as all other
things whatsoever</i>; which being drawn in form, was enter’d
in the Black Book; but has since receiv’d many
alterations: And there is an instance, 1 <i>Eliz.</i> when the
Oath has been dispensed with; as by the Duke of <i>Norfolk</i>,
and others, in regard the Rites and Ceremonies of
Religion were then altered, and no new form of an Oath
settled, so that they only obliged themselves by Promise
to observe such Statutes and Orders as should be decreed
in the next Council of the Order, which was soon after
settled, and recorded in the Red Book of the Order, and
is the Oath taken by a Knight-Subject at this Day.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>You being Chosen to be one of the Honourable Company
of this most Noble Order of the Garter, shall Promise and
Swear, by the Holy Evangelists, by you here touched, that,
wittingly or willingly, you shall not break any Statute of
the said Order, or any Articles in them contained; the
same being agreeable, and not repugnant to the Laws of
Almighty God, and the Laws of this Realm, as far forth
as to you belongeth and appertaineth: So help you God, and
this Holy Word.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as the Knight elect hath taken the Oath, he
is led to his appointed Stall, through the Entrance next
beneath it, and there placed before it. In the Interim,
Garter advancing into the lower row of Stalls, to the
Place where the elect Knight stood when he took the
Oath, presents from thence the Mantle, Collar, and
Book of Statutes, to those who led him, who invest the
Knight elect first with the Mantle, by putting it on his
Shoulders. There are some Examples where the elect
Knight hath been invested before he went up to his Stall,
<span class='pageno' title='340' id='Page_340'></span>as in the case of the Earl of <i>Northumberland</i>, 5 <i>Eliz.</i> <i>Francis</i>,
Duke <i>de Montmorency</i>, and others, 14 <i>Eliz.</i> the Earls
of <i>Dunbar</i> and <i>Montgomery</i>, 6 <i>Jac.</i> I. and the Prince
of <i>Wales</i>, 14 <i>Car.</i> I. among which may be numbered those
installed at the Grand Feast of St. <i>George</i>, 13 <i>Car.</i> II.
but this happen’d through a vast Concourse of People in
the Chapel, that prevented the due Order.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Red Book it is observed, that the Investiture
with the Mantle and Collar, hath been sometimes performed
by the Black Rod; as at the Installation of the
Earl of <i>Northampton</i>, 5 <i>Car.</i> I. the Lord Treasurer <i>Weston</i>,
the Earls of <i>Exeter</i> and <i>Lindsey</i>, and the Marquiss of <i>Hamilton</i>,
6 <i>Car.</i> I. Nevertheless, this is to be understood as
this Officers Assistance to the Knights-Companions, whose
Office it only is, and no otherwise. Whilst the Ceremony
of Investiture with the Mantle is performing, the Words
of Admonition proper thereto, are pronounced as follows.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Take this Mantle of Heavenly Colours, in Sign and Token
of the most Honourable Order you have receiv’d, and to the
increase of your Honour, signed and marked as you see, with
a red Escutcheon of our Lord’s Cross, to the intent that you,
being always defended by the Virtue and Strength thereof,
may pass through your Enemies, and them also overcome and
vanquish, so that at the last, for your worthy and approved
Acts, you may, after this Temporal Chivalry, come to Eternal
Triumphant Joys in Heaven.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>But at the Installation of King <i>Charles</i> II. they receiv’d
some alteration, and were put in the following Form.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Receive this Robe of Heavenly Colour, the Livery of this
most excellent Order, in augmentation of thy Honour, enobled
with the Shield and Red Cross of our Lord, by whose Power
thou may’st safely pierce Troops of thy Enemies, and be over
them ever Victorious; and being in this temporal Warfare
Glorious in egregious and heroick Actions, thou may’st obtain
Eternal and Triumphant Joy.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Next, the Commissioners, Assistants, or Knights-Companions,
lay the Hood on the Knight’s right Shoulder
over the Mantle, and bringing the Tippet athwart his
Breast, tuck it under the Girdle, at which his Sword
<span class='pageno' title='341' id='Page_341'></span>hangs: And lastly tye the Collar about his Shoulder,
over his Mantle and Hood; and at this part of the Investiture,
the following Words of Admonition are likewise
pronounced.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>To the encrease of your Honour, and in Token of the Honourable
Order you have receiv’d; take this Collar about
your Neck, with the Image of the Holy Martyr, and Christ’s
Knight, St.</i> George, <i>by whose aid you being defended, may
pass through the Prosperities and Adversities of this World,
that having here the Victory, as well of your Ghostly as Bodily
Enemies, you may not only receive the Glory and Renown of
Temporal Chivalry, but also at the last, the endless and everlasting
reward of Victory.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>This Form of Words receiv’d likewise alteration when
King <i>Charles</i> II. was to be installed, to the Tenor following.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Wear this Collar about thy Neck, adorn’d with the Image
of the Blessed Martyr and Soldier of Christ, St.</i> George,
<i>by whose Imitation provoked, thou may’st so overpass both
prosperous and adverse Encounters, that having stoutly vanquished
thy Enemies, both of Body and Soul, thou may’st not
only receive the Praise of this transient Combat, but be
Crowned with the Palm of eternal Victory.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Antiently at the Solemnity of Installation, when the
Sovereign, or his Lieutenant was present, the elect
Knight, after he had been invested with the Mantle in
his Stall, was immediately conducted out of the Choir,
back to the Chapter-House, where the Sovereign, or
Lieutenant, used to remain till his return, there to receive
the Collar of the Order from one of them, which done,
he is said to have receiv’d the entire Possession of his Habit.
This is contained in King <i>Henry</i> VIII’s Statutes,
and appears to have been the Practice about that Time,
as in the case of the Lord <i>Mountjoy</i>, and others, 18 <i>Hen.</i> VIII.
and several others after, in the 1 and 3 <i>Edw.</i> VI. and the
3, 5, and 14 <i>Eliz.</i> The Proceeding back to the Chapter-House
on this occasion, was much after the manner of
what is before mention’d, except, that here the new installed
Knight took his Place according to the Dignity of
<span class='pageno' title='342' id='Page_342'></span>his Stall. But ’tis observable, that when the Sovereign’s
Lieutenant remained in the Chapter-House, while the
elect Knight proceeded to his Installation, the Usher of
the Black-Rod stayed behind to attend the Lieutenant;
and as soon as the Investiture with the Collar was over,
the Lieutenant proceeded to the Choir in the Rear, and
the new installed Knight in Place according to his Stall,
as in the case of the Lord <i>Russel</i>, and others, 31 <i>Hen.</i> VIII.
and the Marquiss of <i>Dorset</i>, and others, 1 <i>Edw.</i> VI. The
Proceeding having entered the Choir, and the Lieutenant
and Knights-Companions taken their Seats, then the usual
Ceremonies, the Service of the Church began.</p>

<p class='c000'>But when the Installation was performed by Commissioners,
the Collar of the Order was laid on the Cushion
with the Mantle, and born before the elect Knight to his
Stall, where, after his Investiture with the Mantle and
Hood, he receiv’d Investiture with the Collar also, of
which there are several Examples in the time of <i>Phil.</i> and
<i>Mar.</i> and Queen <i>Eliz.</i> In like manner, at all Installations
since, where the Sovereign has been present, the ancient
custom of returning to the Chapter-House being laid aside,
the Knights-Companions, who led the elect Knights to
their Stalls, did there invest them with their Collars also;
as the Earl of <i>Rutland</i>, Sir <i>George Villars</i>, and the Viscount
<i>Lisle</i>, 14 <i>Jac.</i> I. and the Earl of <i>Suffolk</i>, 4 <i>Car.</i> I.
and hath been thus observed at all Installations since, the
Sovereign present.</p>

<p class='c000'>So soon as the Investiture with the Mantle, Hood, and
Collar is over, those appointed deliver the Book of Statutes
to the new invested Knight, which was observed to
the Earls of <i>Shrewsbury</i> and <i>Cumberland</i>, 34 <i>Eliz.</i> the Earl
of <i>Rutland</i>, Sir <i>George Villars</i>, and the Viscount <i>Lisle</i>,
14 <i>Jac.</i> I. and so generally to all elect Knights since.
This Book the Knight is to keep safe in his own Custody,
for his Instruction in the Laws and Ceremonies of this
most Noble Order. They likewise give him the Black
Velvet Cap adorned with Plumes of white Feathers, and
this in particular was observed to be the last Ceremony
performed at the Installation of King <i>Charles</i> II.</p>

<p class='c000'>All things relating to the full Investiture being ended,
there remains only to compleat this great Ceremony, the
Installation it self, which is performed in the manner following.
The new invested Knight standing before his
<span class='pageno' title='343' id='Page_343'></span>Stall, and turning toward the High Altar, makes humble
Obeysance that way, and then toward the Sovereign, or
if absent, toward his Stall; which done, the Commissioners,
Knights-Assistants, or Knights-Companions, receive and
embrace him with great Civility, as their Fellow and Companion,
and set him down in his assigned Stall with Professions
of Esteem, and Wishes for his Honour and Happiness.
Of this Ceremony, there is a notable Instance at
the Installation of <i>Philip</i>, King of <i>Castile</i>, 22 <i>Henry</i> VII.
where the Sovereign personally introduced him to his
Stall, and there placed him, at which time there was a certain
Form of Words pronounced relating to the elect
Knight’s Session, and Act of Installation, no less than at
his Investiture, but the same are not repeated.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>The Order to be observed when two or more Knights <br />are installed in one Day.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 8. In this case it seems to have been the ancient
Practice, when the Ceremony has been perform’d by two
Commissioners, or two Knights-Assistants, that as soon
as they had finished all the Ceremonies due to the Senior
of them, they left him possest of his Stall, and forthwith
returned to the Chapter-House in the usual manner, and
thence conducted the next Senior elect Knight, and so of
the rest; So it was at the Installation of <i>Albro Vasques
d’Almadea</i>, Earl of <i>Averenches</i>, the Lord <i>Beauchamp</i>, and
Sir <i>Thomas Hoo</i>, in the time of <i>Henry</i> VI. and so of the
Earl of <i>Huntington</i>, 1 <i>Edw.</i> VI. when the two Assistants,
after they had invested and installed the said Earl, returned
to the Chapter-House for the Lord <i>la War</i>, and so
for the Lord <i>Cobham</i>, and Sir <i>William Herbert</i>. In like
manner, when the Commissioners had given the Proctor to
<i>Emanuel</i>, Duke of <i>Savoy</i>, Possession of his Principal’s Stall,
1 and 2 <i>Phil.</i> and <i>Mar.</i> they proceeded back for <i>William</i>
Lord <i>Howard</i>; so by the Earl of <i>Pembrook</i>, 16 <i>Eliz.</i>
when they had first installed the Earl of <i>Derby</i>, and by
the Earl of <i>Cumberland</i>, after the Earl of <i>Shrewsbury</i> had
been installed.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Sovereign hath nominated three Commissioners,
they have returned altogether to fetch in the other
Knights singly, that were to be installed, and alternately
<span class='pageno' title='344' id='Page_344'></span>changed their Places in the proceeding to the several Installations,
one of them always going single before; as at
the Installation of the Earls of <i>Essex</i> and <i>Ormond</i>, and
Sir <i>Christopher Hatton</i>, 30 <i>Eliz.</i> when the Earl of <i>Worcester</i>,
the Lords <i>Hunsdon</i> and <i>Grey</i>, were Commissioners:
And if the Lieutenant had four Assistants assigned him,
which was necessary when many Knights were to be installed,
the order of their Installation hath been as follows.</p>

<p class='c000'>First, Two of the Senior Knights-Assistants conducted the
Senior elect Knight to his Installation, and the other two
Assistants proceeded with the second elect Knight; the
former then took the third elect Knight, and so alternately
changed till all were installed: As at the Installation of
<i>Francis</i>, Duke <i>de Montmorency</i>, and others, 14 <i>Eliz.</i> And
the like manner of alternate change is observed if four
Commissioners be constituted, as at the Installation of
<i>Frederick</i>, King of <i>Denmark</i>, and <i>John</i>, Prince Palatine
of the <i>Rhine</i>, 25 <i>Eliz.</i> where the King’s Proxy was conducted
into the Choir between the Earl of <i>Leicester</i> and
the Lord <i>Hunsdon</i>, the two Senior Commissioners; and
the Prince, between the Earl of <i>Huntington</i> and the Lord
<i>Charles Howard</i>, the two Junior Commissioners.</p>

<p class='c000'>But some have been of Opinion, that the Commissioners
named to this Employment, ought not to divide the Duty,
and part of them to Instal one, and part the other, and
by such an alternative to dispatch the Ceremony, as in
former Cases; but all jointly assist at each Installation:
Of which Opinion there is an Instance at the Installation
of the Earl of <i>Salisbury</i>, and the Viscount <i>Bindon</i>, 4 <i>Jac.</i> I.
where the Earl having been brought into the Choir, invested
and installed by the Earls of <i>Nottingham</i> and <i>Suffolk</i>,
the two Senior Commissioners, the other two Commissioners
who were left behind in the Chapter-House,
to conduct the Viscount to his Stall, remembring that all
four were joint Commissioners, apprehended that the Earl
was not legally installed, because they, as Co-partners in
the Commission, had not assisted; and this Opinion being
debated, prevailed so far, that it was agreed to be imparted
to the Earl of <i>Salisbury</i>, who submitted to descend into
the lower Seats before his Stall, and there all four Commissioners
gave him his Oath again, then led him to his
<span class='pageno' title='345' id='Page_345'></span>Stall, and a second Time invested and installed him; and
so of the Viscount <i>Bindon</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>But this Method was not only new, but different from
former Practice, as in all the cases before recited; and
besides, where the Sovereign hath authorized his Lieutenant
to perform this Ceremony, and appointed some of
the Knights-Companions to assist, they, and not the
Lieutenant, have done the Duty belonging to Installation,
that part of it of investing with the Collar in the Chapter-House,
the whole Duty at the Installation of Prince
<i>Henry</i> excepted. And ’tis to be farther observed, that the
foregoing case of the joint Assistance in the Installation of
the Earl of <i>Salisbury</i>, was thought so little Essential, or
worthy of becoming a Precedent, that at the very next
Feast, when the Earls of <i>Dunbar</i> and <i>Montgomery</i> were
installed, 6 <i>Jac.</i> I. and four Commissioners appointed, the
two Senior installed the Earl of <i>Dunbar</i>, and the two
Junior the Earl of <i>Montgomery</i>; and so again, 10 <i>Car.</i> I.
by the Earls of <i>Danby</i> and <i>Moreton</i>. But lastly, if the Sovereign
be present, and consequently the Knights-Companions
perform this Ceremony, then there is generally so
many of them as can go through the whole, without
changing, after the manner used when done by Commissioners
or Assistants; in which case the two Senior Knights-Companions
descend from their Stalls, and passing thro’
the Choir to the Chapter-House with the Proceeding before
them, conduct to his Installation the eldest elect
Knight; and having performed that whole Ceremony, return
and take their Stalls, and so the rest in due Order;
as was practised at the Installation of Prince <i>Henry</i>, and
others, 1 <i>Jac.</i> I. and of the Earl of <i>Rutland</i>, 14 <i>Jac.</i> I.
and at the grand Feast of St. <i>George</i>, 13 <i>Car.</i> II. but here
the separate proceeding with each single Knight to and
from the Chapter House, taking too much time, and the
Day being far spent in the Ceremonies of the Dukes of
<i>Ormond</i> and <i>Buckingham</i>; the Sovereign ordered, that
with the next Proceeding, the rest of the elect Knights,
being eight, besides two Proxies, should all be introduced
at once; so that each of them being placed before his
Stall, took the Oath, receiv’d his Investiture, and was
led up to his Stall, and took Possession of it by solemn Installation.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='346' id='Page_346'></span>And in regard so many Knights elect were introduced
together, it was judged necessary, that their Mantles and
Collars should be likewise brought in the proceeding,
and each elect Knight appointed one of the Gentlemen that
attended him, to bear the Cushion whereon they were laid,
before him to the Choir Door, where they held them in
their Arms, till Garter in due order fetch’d them into the
Choir: And here we may insert this general Rule, that
at all Installations, where some of the elect Knights are
not sent for unto the Chapter-House, to receive Investiture
with the Surcoat, before the Senior elect Knight
hath been conducted to his Stall, but left to repose themselves
in the East Isle of the Chappel, as hath often happened,
the Knights Commissioners, or Assistants, on their
return to the Chapter-House, send Garter for the next
Senior elect Knight, whom they receive at the Door
thereof, and having invested him with his Surcoat, and
girt his Sword about him, proceed with him to his Installation
in the usual manner. And the same method is
observed if there were more elect Knights to follow; and
we find it 30 <i>Henry</i> VIII. 16, and 34, and 10 <i>Car.</i> I.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Knight, or Knights, having now receiv’d a compleat
Installation, the Knights-Commissioners, Assistants, or
Knights-Companions, with marks of Respect, take their
leave of the last installed Knight, and descending into the
Choir, take their own Stalls; but the Senior Knight-Companion
ascends first: But observe, that if the Stalls
of the Knights-Commissioners, Assistants, or Knights-Companions,
be on the same side with the last installed
Knight, then they descend not into the Choir, but pass
directly to them along the Stalls, as in the 34 <i>Eliz.</i> The
Ceremonies of Installation being finished, the Officers of
Arms first, next the Alms-Knights, descend from the
Steps of the Altar, and take their several Stations in the
Choir; then one of the Prebends of the College, or, if
the Sovereign be present, the Prelate, with the Serjeant
of the Vestry before him, is conducted to the Altar by
the Verger of the Chappel, and there begins the Service
appointed by the Church, which being ended, the Proceeding
passes out of the Choir in usual Order, either to
the Presence-Chamber, or the Lieutenants, or Commissioners
Lodgings, as the Occasion is.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' title='347' id='Page_347'></span>
<h3 class='c010'><i>The Offering of Gold and Silver.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>§ 9. But if the Installation be solemnized in the Morning,
the Service of the Church having proceeded as far
as the Offertory, two of the Prebends, appointed to recieve
the Offering, are conducted to the Altar by their
Verger, and first the Alms-Knights, then the Officers of
Arms, ascend the Steps of the Altar again, and stand in
order as before. After which, Garter Summons down the
Knights-Companions to the Offering, who descend into
the Choir under their proper Stalls, as does the Sovereign’s
Lieutenant, who offers first for the Sovereign, he receiving
the Bezant from the Senior Knight, and then returns
to his Stall: And at this instant, was the usual time heretofore
for offering the Defunct Knights Atchievements,
which was altered by King <i>James</i> I. as will be seen hereafter.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Lieutenant, after a short stay in his Stall, descends
again, and proceeds up to the Altar, to make his own Offering
of Gold and Silver, and then returns, as do the rest
of the Knights-Companions, including those newly installed,
in their due order. But when the Installation passes
by Commissioners, there is then no Offering made for
the Sovereign, but the Commissioners offer first, and after
them the other Knights in due order.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Ceremony of Offering at the Installation of <i>Philip</i>,
King of <i>Castile</i>, 22 <i>Henry</i> VII. is remarkable. He descended
from his Stall into the Choir, and standing before
it, as the other Knights-Companions did, the Sovereign
left his Royal Stall to proceed to the Offering, to which
the King would have followed, but the Sovereign would
not permit, obliging the King to proceed along with him,
on his left Hand, though he desired to perform his Duty
as a Brother of the Order, so that they made their Offerings
so near together, where, though the Sovereign had the
Precedence, yet ’twas hardly observable.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Of the grand Dinner at the Installation.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 10. On the Day of Installation, there hath, from ancient
Time, been appointed a Noble and Sumptuous Feast,
<span class='pageno' title='348' id='Page_348'></span>and though it was agreed on in a Chapter, 3 <i>Edward</i> VI.
<i>That the Knights elect might, from thenceforth, be installed by
Commission without a Feast</i>; yet after his Reign, we find
the old custom of a Feast at this Solemnity restored.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the Sovereign appoint the Installation to be when the
Feast of St. <i>George</i> is also celebrated, and is himself personally
present, the Feast is then kept at the Sovereign’s
Charge; and if in such case he constitute a Lieutenant,
then the Installation Dinner is kept at the Charge of the
Lieutenant; and is usually prepared in some of the Sovereign’s
Lodgings in the Castle, but seldom in St. <i>George</i>’s
Hall; as was done by the Earl of <i>Arundel</i>, at the Installation
of the Earl of <i>Shrewsbury</i>, and the Lord <i>Hunsdon</i>, 3 <i>Eliz.</i>
But when the Installation is kept at any other time of the
Year, than that of St. <i>George</i>’s Feast, then the new installed
Knights are at all the Expence; who generally have
had the Dinner prepared in the Dean’s Lodgings; however,
be it where it will, the Sovereign, or his Lieutenant,
Commissioners, or Assistants, together with the
new installed Knights, proceed thither in full Robes;
which is observed in the Installation of 3 <i>Eliz.</i> above, to
be according to the ancient Custom. At the Installation,
31 <i>Henry</i> VIII. the Sovereign’s Lieutenant walked alone,
after him his two Assistants, and lastly the new installed
Knights.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Lieutenant’s Place at the Table is somewhat on the
left Hand the Cloath of State, there sat the Earl of <i>Arundel</i>,
3 <i>Eliz.</i> but the other four Knights-Companions, his
two Assistants, and the two new installed Knights, sat
toward the Table’s End on both Sides, for that they could
not well sit all on a side. But of late Years, as at the
Installation, 5 <i>Car.</i> I. a Question arose, whether the Lieutenant
or Commissioners should sit at Dinner in their
Habits, since the Power given them seemed to expire
when the Knights were elected; (though unanimously allowed
the new installed Knights ought to do so,) and likewise
Precedents quoted, as 29 <i>Henry</i> VIII. at the Installation
of the Lord <i>Cromwell</i>, where the Knights put off
their Habits, and dined in their ordinary Apparel; and so
of the Earl of <i>Rutland</i>, and the Lord <i>Cobham</i>, 26 <i>Eliz.</i>
where the Commissioners did the same, and the new installed
Knights kept on only their Surcoats: But what
followed on this Debate is not mention’d; but the general
<span class='pageno' title='349' id='Page_349'></span>Practice at other Times hath been of keeping on the
Habit till the Dinner is ended.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the second Course, called also second Mess, or second
Service, Garter, accompanied with the Officers of
Arms, Proclaims the Stiles and Titles of Honour of the
Sovereign (if he be personally, or by his Lieutenant, present,)
in <i>Latin</i>, <i>French</i>, and <i>English</i>, and cries Largess thrice;
next the Stiles of the new installed Knights in <i>French</i>, or
<i>English</i> only, with two Largesses, and in that Order they were
installed. And thus it was at the Installation of <i>Charles</i>,
Duke of <i>York</i>, 9 <i>Jac.</i> I. of <i>Frederick</i>, Prince Palatine, 10
<i>Jac.</i> I. and the Earl of <i>Rutland</i>, and others, 14 <i>Jac.</i> I.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Philip</i>, King of <i>Castile</i>, Dined with the Sovereign in
his Privy-Chamber, 22 <i>Henry</i> VII. whose Stile was Proclaimed
by Garter, not in the same Room, but at the Sovereign’s
great Chamber-Door, and in St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Hall</i>,
after Largess had been thrice cryed. When the Sovereign
constitutes a Lieutenant, then is the Lieutenant’s Stile
also Proclaimed, and to his other Honours is added this
of his Lieutenancy, and afterwards the Stiles of the new
installed Knights, as 3 <i>Eliz.</i> But the Order of this Ceremony
is more particularly observed at the Installation of
the Duke <i>de Montmorency</i>, and others, 14 <i>Eliz.</i> where
first Garter cried Largess, and next Proclaimed the Sovereign’s
Stile, <i>&amp;c.</i> in three Languages, then stepping
two Foot back, Proclaims the Lieutenant’s Stile in <i>French</i>
only, with two Largesses; and after that, he cried one
Largess for the Duke; and lastly, for all the other new
installed Knights, only two Largesses, and the Officers of
Arms did the like; and still as Garter had finished his
Proclamation, the Heralds joined with him in crying
Largess, and so with Reverence departed the Hall.</p>

<p class='c000'>But lastly, it is proper to observe, that when neither
the Sovereign, nor his Lieutenant, are present, then the
Sovereign’s Stile is not Proclaimed, nor those of the Commissioners,
but only of the new installed Knights.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as Dinner is ended, the Knights-Companions
rise from Table, and withdraw to disrobe themselves,
and therewith the Solemnity of Installation ends: And
if at any time the Solemnity continues that Evening, and
the following Day, it is only because the Sovereign (or
his Lieutenant,) is present, on account of celebrating St.
<i>George</i>’s Feast, and not with reference to the Installation.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' title='350' id='Page_350'></span>
<h3 class='c010'><i>Of setting up the Knight’s Atchievements.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>§ 11. The last thing to be done at this great Solemnity,
is setting up the <i>Helm</i>, <i>Crest</i>, <i>Sword</i>, <i>Banner</i>, and <i>Plate</i>,
of the new installed Knight, over his Stall in the Chappel
of St. <i>George</i>; to which purpose they are to be provided,
according to the Directions before given.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the Statutes of Institution it is ordained, that the
time for setting up the Atchievements shall be when the
elect Knight comes to <i>Windsor-Castle</i>, that is, to his Installation,
and not before; and the reason is there likewise
given, lest it should happen, he not coming for his
Installation within the time limitted, and consequently the
vacating his Election ensuing, that a new Election being
made, those military Ensigns might not seem to be disgracefully
withdrawn, and an occasion of Dishonour given,
which otherwise could not be avoided, if they should be
suddenly taken down from a Place so high; which demonstrates,
that the intention of this Article extends to the
finishing the Ceremonies of Installation, before the Atchievements
ought to be set up, by so carefully providing
against the Dishonour of taking them down, in case the
Election should become void; which must infallibly happen,
if the Knight elect died but an Hour before he were
compleatly installed. Accordingly, in the ancient Deputations
both to Sir <i>William Philip</i>, and Sir <i>John Falstaff</i>,
Power is given their Proctors first to demand, receive,
and obtain their principal Stalls, and next to tender their
Helms, and Swords, to be hung up in the Choir of
<i>Windsor</i>, according to Custom: And for clearer Information
of the course of this Ceremony, that the Sovereign
impowered his Commissioners, first to give the Deputy
Possession of his Principal’s Stall, and after to receive the
Atchievements, and place them over it: This is to be
considered as a Memorial of the Knights being installed a
Companion of the Order, and ’tis incongruous in the
Rules of Honour to have the Sign or a Memorial of an
Action precede the Action it self.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, the Statutes expresly provide, that the Knights
Atchievements shall not be hung up, till the Duties and
Fees enjoined are first discharged; and ’tis certain, there
<span class='pageno' title='351' id='Page_351'></span>are no Fees due, nor can be claimed, till the Ceremonies
on which they become due are entirely finished. But to
clear all Doubts which may arise upon this Point, it was
at a Chapter held at <i>White-Hall</i>, the fourth of <i>February</i>,
22 <i>Car.</i> II. ordained, <i>That not any of the Atchievements
of an elect Knight’s Stall be set up in the Chappel at</i> Windsor,
<i>before he be installed, and the Fees of Installation
paid</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>And though this was the Practice anciently, yet were
the Atchievements always prepared and brought to <i>Windsor</i>,
and set before the elect Knight’s Stall; and in case of
his not coming to receive Installation, then, being no
otherwise placed, they might be the easier removed without
the Choir, in as decent manner as could be, so that
the Honour of Knighthood might be preserved entire; nevertheless,
to be retained for publick Use, and the Benefit
of the College.</p>

<p class='c000'>Where mention is made in the Annals of any Person
employed to set up the Atchievements of a Knight, it is
to be understood that he was his Proctor, and installed
on his behalf: And there appears but one single Instance
where one Person hath hung up a Knight’s Atchievements,
when another was installed for him; and this happen’d
14th of <i>August</i>, <i>Anno</i> 29 <i>Hen.</i> VI. where the Lord <i>Rivers</i>
having been elected to the Stall of the Lord <i>Hungerford</i>,
his Sword and Helm were soon after (sent) hung up
by <i>William Bobden</i>, his Esq; and <i>Guyen Herald</i>, and he
installed the 30 <i>October</i> following, by Sir <i>William Crafford</i>
his Proctor; but this was contrary to the Law of
the Order.</p>

<p class='c000'>Where the setting up of a Knight’s Atchievements is
barely mentioned, without taking notice of the Installation,
it is to be understood, that such Knight’s Installation was
also solemniz’d at that Time: As in the case of the King
of <i>Portugal</i>, of whom the Annals only note, that he had
taken care to set over his Stall, Helm, Sword, and Banner,
and all things belonging thereto, at the Feast at
<i>Windsor</i>, 2 <i>Henry</i> VI. In what manner these Atchievements
are fixed, appears by the Statutes; the Helm and
Crest to be set over each Knight-Companion’s Stall, and
the Sword to hang directly under them; but the Plate
to be nailed to the back of the Knight’s Stall.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='352' id='Page_352'></span>
  <h2 id='ch13' class='c005'>CAP. XIII.<br /> <br /><i>The Installation of a Knight-Subject by Proxy.</i></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'><i>The Original Cause of making Proxies.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 1.</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c009'>There
was no liberty given at the Institution of
the Order, for a Knight-Subject to be installed
by his Proctor or Deputy; but on
the contrary, in the Founder’s Statutes was inserted this
express Prohibition. <i>That none of the Knights elect
should be permitted to be installed by</i> Proxy, <i>unless he were
a Stranger</i>. And this Law continued unaltered till the
Reign of <i>Henry</i> V. when <i>John</i> Duke of <i>Bedford</i>, the Sovereign’s
Deputy for holding the Feast of St. <i>George</i> at
<i>Windsor</i>, 7 <i>Henry</i> V. and other the Knights-Companions
then present, took it into Consideration; that where a
Knight-Subject, elected into the Order, was at that Time
employed beyond Sea, in the Service of his Prince, and
likely to continue in that Service some time, it was agreed,
that the said Duke should make an Address to the Sovereign,
by Letters under the Seal of the Order, (he being
then employed in the War against <i>France</i>,) that in the
like cases his Majesty would Ordain, <i>That</i> Knights-Subjects
<i>might, as well as</i> Strangers, <i>be admitted into the</i>
Order, <i>notwithstanding the Clause in the Statutes</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>It likewise appears from that <i>Letter</i>, as well as from
the Blue-Book, that Sir <i>John Grey</i>, and the Lord <i>Bourchier</i>,
had been installed at the aforesaid Feast, by their
several Proxies; which the Sovereign’s Deputy concurr’d
with, out of great Respect to their Persons; lest by a
too rigid Observance of the Statutes, by their absence in
the Wars, where they were then loyally employed, and
might meet their Deaths, they should want the desired
Suffrages of those Masses, ordained to be Sung for a defunct
Knight; as had happen’d to several by unsuspected
delays. But to clear this matter, for the future it was
Decreed, 9 <i>Hen.</i> V. That where any elect Knight was
<span class='pageno' title='353' id='Page_353'></span>actually in the Sovereign’s Wars, or otherwise employed
Abroad on his Sovereign’s Affairs, he should possess the
Privilege of a Stranger in this particular; which Decree
was added to King <i>Henry</i> Vth’s Statutes. And it was soon
after enjoined the elect Knight, on notice of his Election,
to take care timely to appoint his Proctor, that he might
enjoy the Rights and Privileges of a Founder: Such an
Obligation was laid on Sir <i>John Falstaff</i>, who, at the
reception of the Garter, was in <i>France</i>, employed in the
Sovereign’s Service.</p>

<p class='c000'>But King <i>Henry</i> VIII. besides his Confirmation of this
Decree, for allowance of a Proxy in the aforesaid two
Cases, farther enlarged it, to such as the Sovereign should
either Command, or permit Licence to be installed by
Proxy, which is to be understood of Knights elect within
the Kingdom, as well as those beyond Sea: By Virtue
of which Clause, the elect Knight, the Earl of <i>Dorset</i> being
Sick, 1 <i>Car.</i> I. obtained the Sovereign’s Licence to
be installed by his Deputy Sir <i>Richard Young</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Letters of Procuration.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 2. It is observed before, out of the <i>Registrum Chartaceum</i>,
that Sir <i>John Robesart</i>, elected into the Order
by King <i>Henry</i> V. was installed by Virtue of his Letter
Missive, sent to Sir <i>Thomas Barr</i> his Proxy; but the
same Register calls it, in another Place, a sufficient Procuration
under his Seal of Arms, enabling him to perform
the Ceremony of his Installation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Copy of this Instrument is not extant; but that
Letter Missive Sir <i>John Grey</i> directed to Sir <i>John Lisle</i>,
to take Possession of his Stall, and by Virtue of which he
was installed, <i>tells him he had Chosen him for his Proxy,
and to take his Stall for him in his Name</i>, &amp;c. And
omitting other Precedents, doubtless, in the case of a
Knight-Subject, the Sovereign may, if he pleases, nominate
and appoint a Proxy for Installation, where the elect
Knight hath not done it himself; for here, all those Considerations
of grand Respect, Forms of the Oath, <i>&amp;c.</i> constantly
afforded to Strangers, have no Place; which is
evident from the Sovereign’s Letters of Summons to the
Commissioners named for Installation of the Lord <i>Grey</i>,
<span class='pageno' title='354' id='Page_354'></span>4 and 5 <i>Phil.</i> and <i>Mar.</i> who at that time was Prisoner
in <i>France</i>, and his Deputy Sir <i>Humphry Radcliffe</i>, is
therein mentioned to be appointed by the Sovereign
herself.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first Precedent of Letters of Procuration, or Deputation,
drawn into a solemn Form, is that made by Sir
<i>William Phelip</i>, 5 <i>Hen.</i> V. by which, having obtained the
Sovereign’s Licence, he impowers two Knights, Sir
<i>Andrew Butrely</i>, and Sir <i>John Henington</i>, or either of
them, as their Business would permit, to supply his Place,
and take Possession of his Stall, in the Choir at <i>Windsor</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Qualifications of a Proxy.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 3. The Qualifications of a Proctor, nominated by a
Knight-Subject, are the same with those requisite in the
Proctor of a Stranger, of which something will fall in
our Way hereafter; I shall therefore only in general observe
here, that to neither Knight-Subject, nor Stranger,
the Proctor is to be under the Degree of a Knight, enobled
with Arms, and of an honest and untainted Reputation;
it being judg’d proper chiefly in this Point, that a
Knight-Subject should exactly observe the same Rule
enjoined to Strangers; in respect of which, it is very
remarkable, that Sir <i>William Lisle</i>, though one of the
Alms-Knights, yet in Degree a Knight, was not refused
to be Proctor to Sir <i>John Grey</i>, 7 <i>Hen.</i> V.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Preparations for Installation.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 4. The Day for Installation of a Knight-Subject by
Proxy, being appointed by the Sovereign, there are to be
provided for him, first, a Commission for Installation,
which by the Chancellor of the Order is presented to the
Sovereign for his Sign Manual; to which is after affixed,
the Seal of the Order: And appoints, 1. To conduct
the Proctor to <i>Windsor-Castle</i>. 2. To put him in Possession,
as from the Sovereign, of the Stall assigned his
Principal. 3. To invest him with all the Benefits,
Honours, Prerogatives, Franchises, and Liberties thereto
belonging. 4. To receive his Mantle, Helm, and Sword,
and set them up in their appointed Places. 5. To add
<span class='pageno' title='355' id='Page_355'></span>thereto all usual Ceremonies. 6. Lastly, an Injunction to
all the Knights to permit all the Solemnity punctually to be
performed: An ancient Precedent of this is found 5 <i>Hen.</i> V.
in the case of Sir <i>John Falstaff</i>: Also 2 <i>Edw.</i> IV. at the
Installation of the Earl of <i>Worcester</i>, and other elect
Knights, by their Proxies.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of later Times, the Commissions granted on such Occasions
differ from those made for the Personal Installation
of the Knights themselves, only by premising the
Cause of their Principal’s Absence, and Service he is then
employed on; authorizing the Commissioners to admit
the Proxy into his Stall: Likewise where the Installation is
performed by two or more Commissioners, the Sovereign
directs Letters to each of them, giving notice of the intended
Solemnity, and requiring them to attend at a Day
prefixt, to the end the Proxy may be put into Possession
of his Principal’s Stall.</p>

<p class='c000'>And as there is, upon admission of an elect Knight, installed
by Proxy, the same ground for removal of Stalls,
as in personal Installations; so the Sovereign issues out
Warrants to <i>Garter</i>, some time before the Solemnity, to
remove the Atchievements and Plates, as usual, and
place them in the Order such Warrants direct. Anciently
the Stall for an elect Knight, was assigned in the Commission
issued for Installation, as in the case of Sir <i>Henry
Inghouse</i>, Proctor to Sir <i>John Falstaff</i>, 5 <i>Henry</i> V.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rest of the Particulars to be provided against the
Day of Installation, are at the Knight’s own Charge, and
are agreeable with those in Personal Installations.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Proceeding to the Chapter-House.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 5. The next thing to be consider’d, is the Proxies
Place in proceeding to the Chapter-House, and this is
immediately after the Provincial <i>King of Arms</i>, because as
yet he hath not taken Possession of his Principal’s Stall;
which done, it gives him a Place in his return according to
its Dignity. In this Order the Proctors of the Marquiss of
<i>Newcastle</i>, and the Earl of <i>Bristol</i>, proceeded (Bare-headed,)
13 <i>Car.</i> II.</p>

<p class='c000'>And though this be the Proctor’s usual Place in this
Proceeding, yet Sir <i>Henry Sidney</i>, Proctor to the Earl of
<span class='pageno' title='356' id='Page_356'></span><i>Warwick</i>, 5 <i>Eliz.</i> proceeded immediately before the elect
Knights; which is the only instance of that kind.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lastly, the Proctor, as in the case of an elect Knight,
passes into the East-Isle, behind the High-Altar, as soon
as he comes within St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Chappel</i>, while the Sovereign,
Lieutenant, or Commissioners, proceed into the
Chapter-House, and there reposeth himself till he is sent
for in; as in the case of the Marquiss of <i>Newcastle</i> and
Earl of <i>Bristol</i> above: But if the Proxy pass not in the
Proceeding, he then goes privately to his Place, before
the Proceeding sets forward.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Transactions in the Chapter-House.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 6. After the Chapter is opened, the first thing done,
is for <i>Garter</i> to present the Commission or Commissions,
which he carried in the Proceeding thither, as well
that for the Lieutenancy, (if a Lieutenant held the Feast,)
as of Installation, for admitting a Proxy, the Order of
which is observed before.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Letters of Procuration, or Deputation, are next
read, after which the Proxy is sent for into the Chapter-House
by <i>Garter</i>, who conducts him to the Door, and
there the Commissioners, or Assistants, or Knights-Companions,
receive him. But 5 <i>Eliz.</i> Sir <i>Henry Sidney</i> exhibited
his Deputation, after he was called in: Or sometimes
the Proxy produces his Deputation before the
Proceeding to the Chapter-House, as Sir <i>George Howard</i>,
Deputy to the Earl of <i>Bedford</i>, did, 6 <i>Eliz.</i> And in such
case there is no need of admitting the Proxy into the
Chapter-House, but that he may stay without, till the
Sovereign, his Lieutenant, or Commissioners, are past
into the Choir, and he sent for thither; at which time
the <i>Mantle</i> was wont to be laid on his right Arm at the
Chapter-House Door, by the Knights-Companions appointed
to introduce him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Anciently, as soon as the Proxy was admitted into the
Chapter-House, and the Letters of Procuration were read,
the <i>Mantle</i> of his Principal was usually laid on his right
Arm by the Sovereign’s Lieutenant, or Commissioners,
and part of it spread on the Proxies Shoulders, the Escutcheon
of St. <i>George</i> lying uppermost, and the Cordons
<span class='pageno' title='357' id='Page_357'></span>laid fair to be seen; and in this manner he bore it in
the Proceeding to the Stall, where he held it till
Service was ended; but ’tis now ordered otherwise, as
by the direction of King <i>Charles</i> II. that the <i>Mantle</i>
should be born on the left Arm.</p>

<p class='c000'>But 5 <i>Eliz.</i> the Earl of <i>Warwick</i>’s Proctor had the
Mantle born before him into the Choir by <i>Garter</i>, in the
same manner as is usual to Knights Personally installed;
and not delivered him, till he had taken the Oath; and
at the delivery thereof, the Words of Admonition were
pronounced by the <i>Register</i>; as it was observed to the
Proxies of the Marquiss of <i>Newcastle</i>, and the Earl of
<i>Bristol</i>, 13 <i>Car.</i> II.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Proceeding to the Choir.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 7. The Proxy proceeds from the Chapter-House
Door, between the Sovereign’s Commissioners, <i>&amp;c.</i> But
touching the Order of this Proceeding, so much has
already been said, that we shall give but one Instance,
<i>Anno</i> 6 <i>Elizabeth</i>.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c002'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1. Verger.</div>
      <div class='line'>2. Alms-Knights.</div>
      <div class='line'>3. Officers of Arms.</div>
      <div class='line'>4. Officers of the Order.</div>
      <div class='line'>5. Lord <i>Hunsdon</i>, Proctor to the Lord <i>Cobham</i>.</div>
      <div class='line'>6. Earl of <i>Bedford</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Ceremonies performed in the Choir.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 8. The Proceeding having entered the Choir, the
Commissioners, <i>&amp;c.</i> conduct the Proxy into the lower
Stall, directly under that designed for his Principal,
where the <i>Register</i> reads the Words of the Oath, while
the Proxy, laying his Hand on the Book, repeats them
after him, and Kisses the Book: And this Oath his Deputation
impowers him to take, in the Name of his
Principal; the Form of the Oath having no difference
from the Oath taken Personally by an elect Knight.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Oath being taken in this solemn manner, the
Proctor is led up to the Stall of his Principal, where both
<span class='pageno' title='358' id='Page_358'></span>the Knights, who conducted him into the Choir, first
take the <i>Mantle</i>, and lay it on his Arm, next laying their
Hands on him, in the Name of his Lord and Master,
from whom he received his Deputation, set him down
therein: And so the Ceremony of Installation being fully
ended, the Service of the Church begins.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the Installation be performed in the Morning, there
is an Offering of Gold and Silver; at which time the
Proxy in his turn comes from his Principal’s Stall, and
stands before it, and when the Sovereign, or the Lieutenant
for him, and for himself, or else the Commissioners,
and the rest of the Knights-Companions present,
have offered, then the Proxy (being joined to the Knight,
sitting in the opposite Stall, if present at the Solemnity, and
having two Officers of Arms before them,) proceeds to the
High Altar, and there offers both Gold and Silver; and
then returns, and takes his Stall as the rest do. In this
manner the Earl of <i>Warwick</i>’s Proxy, joining with the
Earl of <i>Northumberland</i>, installed at the same time, proceeded
to the Offering, 5 <i>Eliz.</i> As likewise the Proctor
to the Earl of <i>Bedford</i>, with the Lord <i>Hunsdon</i>, 6 <i>Eliz.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>The Ceremony of the Offering being finished, the Service
of the Church goes on, which being over, the Proceeding
returns in the same Order it came to the <i>Chapter-House</i>,
except, that now the Proxy takes his Place according
to the Dignity of his Stall. But in regard the
<i>Statutes</i> expresly declare; That after the Proxy hath
been admitted to his Principal’s Stall, he shall neither wear
the <i>Mantle</i>, nor have any Voice in Chapter, nor enter
there in the absence of him that sent him; so that it was
the ancient Practice to take off the <i>Mantle</i> from his Arm
at the <i>Chapter-House</i> Door, in his return from the Choir,
and delivered to the <i>Verger</i> of the Chappel, though
sometimes to the <i>Sexton</i>, at other times to <i>Garter</i>, also
to the <i>Black-Rod</i>, who hath taken it from off the Proxies
Arm, and carried it into the Chapter-House; this done,
the Proxy retires privately out of the Proceeding to his
Lodging.</p>

<p class='c000'>It appears however, but by what indulgence is not
mentioned, that though <i>Garter</i> took the <i>Mantle</i> from
Sir <i>Henry Sidney</i>, 5 <i>Eliz.</i> at the Chapter-House Door, on
the Evening he returned from Installation; yet the next
<span class='pageno' title='359' id='Page_359'></span>Morning he rode in the Procession to the Chapel, the
Celebration of the Feast of St. <i>George</i> continuing, with
the <i>Mantle</i> on his right Arm; and having entered the
Choir, took his Principal’s Stall, bearing likewise the
Mantle in the grand Procession, at the Offering of Money,
and during Divine Service, and from the Chappel to
the Castle to Dinner: And the like in the Afternoon of
the said Day, he rode on Horse-back in the Proceeding
to the Chapter-House Door, but there the <i>Mantle</i> was
taken from him, and laid within upon the Table, whilst
he retired into the East-Isle of the Chappel, and at the
rising of the <i>Chapter</i>, it was again delivered to him,
whence he proceeded in his Principal’s Place to the second
Vespers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next Morning, the <i>Lieutenant</i>, and <i>Assistants</i>, having
ended the Chapter, the <i>Mantle</i> was again laid on his
Arm, and in that manner he passed to his Principal’s Stall,
and afterwards offered, as on the Feast Day. The Morning
Service ended, the <i>Lieutenant</i> and <i>Assistants</i> returned
to the Chapter-House Door, where they put off their
<i>Mantles</i>, and at the same time the <i>Sexton</i> of the College
receiv’d the Mantle from him.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>The Grand Dinner.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 9. At Dinner the Proxy sits with the Lieutenant
or Commissioners, and takes Place where his Principal
should sit if he were present; and this was so observed
at the Installation of the Earl of <i>Warwick</i>, 5 <i>Eliz.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>The Stile of the Knight installed by Proxy, is proclaimed
in <i>French</i>, or <i>English</i>, in the usual Form and
Place, as 25 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. at the Installations of the Earls of
<i>Beaumont</i> and <i>Newblanke</i>, by their Proxies; for they were
Knight-Subjects, though not to the Sovereign, and therefore
not improper to be made use of as an Instance.
To conclude, the Proctor is to take care that the Atchievements
and Plate of his Principal are set up in their
proper Places, which appears not only from the ancient
Letters of Procuration, but also by Commissions of Installation,
which appoint that the Sovereign’s Deputy
should receive from the Proctor his Principal’s Helm and
<span class='pageno' title='360' id='Page_360'></span>Sword, (for there is no mention of the Banner till afterwards,)
and place it over his Stall.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch14' class='c005'>CAP. XIV.<br /> <br /><i>The Signification of Election to Strangers.</i></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Within what time, and in what manner, Certificate <br />is made of their Election.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 1.</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c009'>In
regard that Strangers elect, are for the most
part Sovereign Princes, whole Affairs obliged
them to abide in their own Dominions, and
very rarely permitted them to receive Personal Installation,
it was thought fit to allow them several Privileges, by the
Founder of this most <i>Noble Order</i>, and principally, that
of giving previous and timely Notice of their Elections,
and convenient time of consideration for Acceptance;
affording Investiture in their own Countries, and permitting
their Installations to be performed at <i>Windsor</i> by their
Proxies or Deputies.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was therefore by the <i>Statutes</i> ordained: That when
any such should be chosen into the <i>Order</i>, they should be
certified of their Elections by the Sovereign; and besides,
that, at his Charge, the <i>Garter</i> should be sent over to them,
with the <i>Mantle</i> and <i>Statutes</i> of the <i>Order</i>, Sealed with
the common Seal; so that they might have notice, at
least within four Months from the time of Election, to the
end they might advise and determine with themselves,
from the Tenor of the <i>Statutes</i>, whether they would receive
the Honour of this most <i>Noble Order</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Pursuance of these Directions, it became customary
for the Sovereign, when he sent his Letters, to send also,
and that by way of solemn Embassy, the Habit and
Ensigns of the <i>Order</i>, with a Book of the <i>Statutes</i>; and in
case the Election were accepted, Investiture might be received
before the return of the Persons, by whom the
<span class='pageno' title='361' id='Page_361'></span>Habit was sent. As upon the Elections of <i>Edward</i>, King
of <i>Portugal</i>, at the Feast of St. <i>George</i>, 13 <i>Hen.</i> VI. the
Duke of <i>Urbin</i>, 14 <i>Edw.</i> IV. and several others.</p>

<p class='c000'>The right of bearing these Letters signifying Election,
and returning the Strangers Answer, belongs to <i>Garter</i>,
by the Constitutions of his Office. And though Certificate
of Election was to be made within four Months
from the time of Election, yet King <i>Henry</i> VIII. added
this necessary Clause: <i>That when the Sovereign had any
great or high Impediment, he might defer certifying the
Election till a more convenient Time</i>. As may be seen in
the case of <i>Frederick</i> III. Emperor of <i>Germany</i>, in the
time of <i>Henry</i> VI. who having been elected 35 of that
King, had not Letters sent him to signify it till the next
Year. It likewise appears, that Letters to the same Effect
were then likewise dispatched to the King of <i>Arragon</i>,
the Duke of <i>Brunswick</i>, and King of <i>Poland</i>, who had
been elected eight Years before.</p>

<p class='c000'>And yet we find it recorded, that the <i>Habit</i> and <i>Ensigns</i>
of the <i>Order</i> were sent by special Ambassadors to all
three, 34 <i>Hen.</i> VI. two Years before: But perhaps this
ought to be understood of their being but then design’d,
and ordered to be sent, and on second Thoughts might be
stopped, or if sent, by some accident might have miscarried;
otherwise it seems needless to have sent other Letters
to give notice of their Election two Years after: But
to clear this matter, we after find a second mention of
sending the <i>Habit</i> and <i>Ensigns</i> to the King of <i>Poland</i>,
37 <i>Hen.</i> VI. by which it is demonstrable, that the first
Embassy took no Effect.</p>

<p class='c000'>It does not appear that King <i>Hen.</i> VIII. or any of his
Successors, ever made use of that Liberty granted by the
aforesaid Article of his <i>Statutes</i>, for deferring the significatory
Letters of Election beyond the time appointed by
the <i>Statutes</i> of Institution, as we find by the many Instances
of that kind. <i>Francis</i> the first King of <i>France</i> was
elected <i>October</i> 21. 19 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. and was installed the 25
<i>January</i> following; so that ’tis plain, the Letters of Notice
must needs have been dispatched within the limited
Time. <i>James</i> V. of <i>Scotland</i>, who was elected 20 <i>Jan.</i>
26 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. had notice of Election immediately sent
him; and <i>Hen.</i> II. of <i>France</i>, having been elected 24
<span class='pageno' title='362' id='Page_362'></span><i>April</i>, 5 <i>Edw.</i> VI. had Letters of Signification sent him
in <i>May</i> following; and so in all Examples since. And
when King <i>Charles</i> II. elected any Stranger whilst he
was Abroad, Letters of Signification were sent them immediately
after.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Of notice given of an Election, before sending the Habit.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 2. Here it is to be observed, with how much caution,
more than the former, the Statutes of King <i>Henry</i> VIII.
Ordain, <i>to send Letters that signify Election, and the
Book of Statutes only at first</i>; but not the <i>Garter</i> and
<i>Mantle</i>, till the <i>elect Stranger</i>, having had time to consult
the Statutes, certifies his acceptance of the <i>Order</i>;
and then, and not before, it is Decreed to send a solemn
Embassy with the whole Habit, <i>George</i>, and <i>Collar</i>: And
consonant to this, the Practice hath sometimes been. As
in the case of <i>Henry</i> II. King of <i>France</i>, 5 <i>Edw.</i> VI.
<i>Emanuel</i>, Duke of <i>Savoy</i>, 1 and 2 <i>Phil.</i> and <i>Mar.</i> and in
that of <i>Frederick</i>, Duke of <i>Wirtembergh</i>, to whom Queen
<i>Elizabeth</i> sent Letters soon after his Election, and he returned
Thanks, and Acceptation, by his two Ambassadors,
who received Promise of sending the whole Habit
soon after; however, the same were not sent during her
Life.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Notice of Election sent with the Habit.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 3. When the Sovereign hath been well assured of the
<i>elect Stranger’s</i> acceptance, the same Embassy (as anciently
before adding this Clause,) dispatched both Ceremonies.
The Sovereign’s Letter signifying Election, being
first presented, together with the Book of Statutes,
and an acceptance declared, then within few Days, the
whole Habit of the <i>Order</i> was solemnly delivered.</p>

<p class='c000'>And thus it was directed soon after the Election of
<i>James</i> V. King of <i>Scots</i>, to the Lord <i>William Howard</i>, sent
on that Embassy; and in like manner, at the Election of
<i>Christian</i> IV. King of <i>Denmark</i>, 1 <i>Jac.</i> I. to the Earl of
<span class='pageno' title='363' id='Page_363'></span><i>Rutland</i> sent on that Embassy. As also to <i>Gustavus Adolphus</i>,
King of <i>Sweden</i>, and <i>Henry</i>, Prince of <i>Orange</i>, within
two Months, their Elections following on <i>April</i> 24.
3 <i>Car.</i> I. and the date of the Commission for delivering
the Order being on <i>June</i> 24. following.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>The manner and order of the delivery of these
Letters, signifying Election, when the Habit is
sent, is thus.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>“First, The Ambassador and <i>Officer of Arms</i> having
notice given them of the first Audience, present themselves
to the <i>Stranger Prince</i>, in the accustomed manner
of Ambassadors; and delivering the Sovereign’s
<i>Letters Missive</i>, with all due Reverence, the Ambassador,
after some short general Compliment from the
Sovereign, signifying that his Master, and the Honourable
<i>Society</i> of the <i>Garter</i>, in respect of his renowned Prowess,
Valour, Virtues, <i>&amp;c.</i> and to establish and encrease
the Amity that is between them, hath elected him into
the most Noble <i>Order</i> of St. <i>George</i>; and that Sovereigns
do never elect any Stranger, but such as they
highly Honour; and therefore earnestly desires it may
be accepted as a true Testimony thereof: To which
end the Sovereign hath sent him over, and his Herald
there present, to perform the due Ceremonies.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But this Commission of Legation hath sometimes been
obstructed by the multitude of Affairs lying on the Sovereign’s
Hands, particularly in the Time of <i>Car.</i> I. when
engaged in that unnatural Civil War; so that when they
sent their Letters of Signification, it was thought fit to
Commissionate their Agent, or Resident at the Prince’s
Court, and <i>Garter</i> Principal <i>King of Arms</i>, to deliver
part; but the two chief and most peculiar <i>Ensigns</i> of the
<i>Order</i>, <i>viz.</i> the <i>Garter</i> and <i>George</i>, deferring the solemn
Embassy till a more convenient Season. The first Precedent
of which kind, was 10 <i>Jac.</i> I. when Sir <i>Ralph
Winwood</i>, and <i>William Seagar</i>, Esq; <i>Garter</i>, were Commissioned
to deliver only, for the present, the Garter and
George, to <i>Maurice</i>, Prince of <i>Orange</i>, five Days after
his Election; and so to <i>Charles</i>, Prince Palatine of the
<span class='pageno' title='364' id='Page_364'></span><i>Rhine</i>, 9 <i>Car.</i> I. and to <i>William</i>, Prince of <i>Orange</i>, and
the Duke <i>de Espernon</i>, the same Reign. And so likewise
during the unhappy Exile of King <i>Charles</i> II. it was usual,
for want of more conveniency, to present the elect Knight,
in confirmation of his Election, whether he were <i>Stranger</i>,
or <i>Subject</i>, with the <i>Garter</i>, <i>George</i>, <i>Ribband</i>; and sometimes
a St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Cross</i>, radicated within a <i>Garter</i>, to
be fixed on the left Shoulder of their Cloaks, or upper
Garments. But these things after returned into their
proper Channel, as we may see in several cases since,
of which we need not instance more, than that of the
present Sovereign, and his Royal Highness the Prince:
The former at a Chapter of the most Noble <i>Order</i>, held
at <i>Kensington</i>, 18 <i>June</i>, 1701. 13 <i>Will.</i> III. was elected,
and on the 21 <i>June</i>, the Sovereign, by Commission under
the Great Seal of the <i>Order</i>, constituted the Earl of
<i>Macclesfield</i>, and <i>Gregory King</i>, Esq; <i>Lancaster Herald</i>,
(then Deputy Garter King of Arms,) to carry the <i>Habit</i>
and <i>Ensigns</i>, and to invest his then Electoral Highness
therewith. The next Day after their arrival, at a private
Audience, his Electoral Highness received the
<i>Garter</i> and <i>George</i>, with the usual Formalities; and
two Days after, <i>viz.</i> 24 <i>August</i>, was solemnly invested
with the whole Habit of the <i>Order</i>. On 13
<i>March</i> following, 1702-3. he was installed at <i>Windsor</i>
by his Proxy <i>Charles</i>, Lord <i>Mohun</i>, with the accustomed
Ceremonies. The same <i>Order</i> was observed
at the Election of his Royal Highness the Prince, 4 <i>April</i>,
5 Queen <i>Anne</i>; when the Lord <i>Halifax</i>, and <i>John
Vanbruge</i>, Esq; <i>Clarenceux</i> King of <i>Arms</i>, (in the room of
Sir <i>Henry St. John</i>, Knight Garter,) were Commission’d to
carry the <i>Habit</i> and <i>Ensigns</i>. They had their first Audience,
on this occasion, of the Prince, the 31 <i>May</i>, who
afterwards received the Garter and lesser George, and on
2 <i>June</i> following, was invested with the whole <i>Habit</i>
and <i>Ensigns</i> of the <i>Order</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Certificates of Acceptation.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 4. After delivering the Sovereign’s Letter, signifying
Election by the Ambassador, and the <i>elect Stranger</i> doth
<span class='pageno' title='365' id='Page_365'></span>readily accept the <i>Order</i>, he is obliged, by the Statutes,
to return the Sovereign a Certificate of such his Acceptance,
and desire of Ratification. And ’tis observable,
before the additional Clause made by King <i>Henry</i> VIII.
this ceremonious Course had been the Practice of ancient
Times; and both expected from, and observed by
the King of <i>Denmark</i>, who having been elected, 6 <i>Hen.</i> V.
was the eighth of the same King taken notice of for not
returning, before that Time, an Answer, whether he
accepted the Honour or no: And it appears, before the
next Feast of St. <i>George</i>, he sent over his ready Acceptance,
both of the Honour of Election, and of the Ensigns
of the <i>Order</i>; and thereupon Directions were given
for his Installation by the Lord <i>Fitz Hugh</i>, his Proxy.</p>

<p class='c000'>But for an instance, after the said additional Clause,
there is one remarkable enough, in the Preamble of the
Sovereign’s <i>Credential Letters</i> to the Duke of <i>Savoy</i>, 1 and
2 <i>Phil.</i> and <i>Mar.</i> sent with the Habit and Ensigns of the
<i>Order</i>; in which it appears: <i>That the Sovereign having
given notice of his Election into this most Noble</i> Order, <i>he
had returned back his cheerful and ready Acceptance of, and
singular Satisfaction in the said Choice; and therefore cordially
wished it might attain its due Effect</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In succeeding Times it was thought necessary, where
the whole <i>Habit</i> was sent to a <i>Stranger</i>, together with the
Sovereign’s Letters of notice, to make a provisional Decree,
(which passed, 13 <i>Car.</i> I) <i>That Garter, and all
others, whom he pleased to join in Commission with him,
should be most punctually careful, that they delivered not
the</i> Ensigns <i>of the</i> Order <i>to any</i> elect Stranger, <i>till they
were satisfied, by his</i> Letters Patent, <i>of his kind and grateful
Acceptance thereof</i>; or in case of refusal, to forbear
their Presentation.</p>

<p class='c000'>And the same care was also taken, where only the
<i>Garter</i> and <i>George</i> were sent; as appears by the Instructions
sent, 19 <i>Car.</i> I. to Sir <i>William Boswel</i>, then appointed
by the Sovereign to present those two principal
Ensigns to <i>William</i>, Prince of <i>Orange</i>; where, among
other things, he is expressly commanded, <i>To take a Testimonial
from the said Prince, of his kind Acceptation thereof,
before he should deliver those Ensigns of Honour to him</i>:
So likewise in the Institutions of the same Date, for delivery
<span class='pageno' title='366' id='Page_366'></span>of the <i>Garter</i> and <i>George</i> to the Duke <i>de Espernon</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Of an Election not accepted.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 5. That sometimes this Honour hath not been accepted,
appears in the single case of <i>Philip</i> II. Duke of <i>Burgundy</i>,
who having been elected by King <i>Henry</i> V. then
in <i>France</i>, had not, <i>Anno</i> 1 <i>Henry</i> VI. sent his Answer.
It was therefore concluded on at the Feast of St. <i>George</i>,
held at <i>Windsor</i> the said Year, by <i>Humphry</i>, Duke of
<i>Gloucester</i>, then Deputy to the Sovereign, and by, and
with the unanimous consent of the <i>Knights-Companions</i>
present, to send Letters to the said elect Duke, by which
he was desired to know, whether he gave his Acceptance
or no? The Duke of <i>Burgundy</i>, it seems, made no
Answer to this Letter: It was therefore again debated at
the next Year’s Feast, and then thought fit, to send Persons
over to him with the Nomination, who should press
him for his final Answer. And then it appears, that the
said Duke weighing the Statutes, and reflecting on the
Quarrels between the Duke of <i>Gloucester</i>, and the Duke
of <i>Brabant</i> his Unckle, made a plausible Excuse, refusing
the Election, lest he should be forced either dishonourably
to violate the pious Constitutions of the <i>Order</i>, or
the obligations of Alliance; and upon this they proceeded
to a new Election.</p>

<p class='c000'>But this is the only instance of this kind; and it hath
been the constant way of all elect Strangers, not only to
accept, but to receive with the highest Marks of Satisfaction,
the notice of their Election, and the Investiture
of the <i>Order</i>.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='367' id='Page_367'></span>
  <h2 id='ch15' class='c005'>CAP. XV.<br /> <br /><i>The Investiture of Strangers, with the Habit and Ensigns of the Order.</i></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'><i>The Time for sending the Habit and Ensigns unlimitted.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 1.</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c009'>Though
the Statutes of the <i>Order</i> appoint and
prefix a time, wherein the Sovereign’s Letters of
notice to an elect Knight ought to be sent, yet
as to the sending a solemn Embassy with the Habit and
Ensigns, they do not limit any certain time, but leave it
wholly to the Sovereign’s Pleasure, wherein his own Interest
and Conveniency, as well as that of the <i>elect Stranger</i>,
is to be considered.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nevertheless, the Statutes of Institution direct, that
this Legation shall be dispatched with convenient speed;
which must be interpreted to refer both to the Sovereign’s
conveniency of sending, and the <i>Stranger’s</i> capacity of receiving.</p>

<p class='c000'>And therefore we find it six Years after the Election of
the Kings of <i>Arragon</i> and <i>Poland</i>, and the Duke of <i>Brunswick</i>,
e’er we meet with the first notice of the Sovereign’s
determination of sending over the Habit: For they having
been elected 4 <i>August</i>, 28 <i>Hen.</i> VI. the preparations for
the <i>Legation</i> were not made till the thirty fourth Year
of the same King; and doubtless some cause, within the
limits of that conveniency allowed to the Sovereign by
the aforesaid Article of the <i>Statutes</i>, or the accident of
Miscarriage might fall out; particularly in respect to the
King of <i>Poland</i>, because three Years after the former
Order of <i>Legation</i>, we find new Directions issued for
sending the Ensigns of the <i>Order</i> to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>But in King <i>Henry</i> VIIIth’s Body of <i>Statutes</i>, this Clause
of sending the Legation with convenient speed, is wholly
omitted, and the Sovereign is not limitted as to the
Time; so that the Habit and Ensigns have happen’d to
be sent sometimes sooner, sometimes later; as the Sovereign
<span class='pageno' title='368' id='Page_368'></span>has thought convenient; of which sufficient hath
been said already; and we find in two Elections of <i>Strangers</i>
in the two late Reigns, <i>viz.</i> that of the present Sovereign
and Prince; that the Legation was sent only a
very few Days after their Election.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Preparations made for the Legation.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 2. In reference to this solemn Embassy, there are
several things to be provided, before the Ambassadors,
or Commissioners, take their Journey. As, (1.) Credential
Letters. (2.) Commission of Legation. (3.) Warrants
for the <i>Habit</i> and <i>Ensigns</i>. And (4.) other Necessaries.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Credential Letters are, as to particulars, drawn
suitable to the present Occasion, by the <i>Chancellor</i> of the
<i>Order</i>, and directed to the <i>Stranger elect</i>; but the Substance,
in general, is, <i>That the Sovereign having elected
him into the Society of the</i> Order, <i>hath sent his Ambassadors
with full Power to present the</i> Habit, <i>and perform the
Ceremonies due and accustomed, as if himself were present</i>.
And farther, to desire him, <i>To give Credit to all that his
Ambassadors shall say, or perform, on his behalf, in reference
to their Commission, as he would do to himself</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>These Letters pass under the Sign Manual of the Sovereign,
and Signet of the <i>Order</i>; but it is observable,
that these to <i>Emanuel</i>, Duke of <i>Savoy</i>, were sign’d both
by King <i>Philip</i> and Queen <i>Mary</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>Commission</i> of <i>Legation</i> is likewise to be prepared
by the <i>Chancellor</i> of the <i>Order</i>, fairly engrossed on Velom,
and Sealed with the <i>Great Seal</i> of the <i>Order</i>, the Substance
of which, for the most part, hath been as follows.</p>

<p class='c000'>First, The Merits and Worthiness of the <i>elect Stranger</i>,
to deserve the Honour of <i>Election</i>, and the reasons of inducing
the Sovereign to confer the same upon him, are
elegantly set forth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Secondly, The Persons nominated for this Honourable
Employment, are ordained, authorized, and deputed,
and therein Stiled, Ambassadors, Procurators, and special
Messengers, and so are acknowledged to be by the <i>Stranger
elect</i>, in their Certificates of the Receipt of the
Habit.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='369' id='Page_369'></span>Thirdly, Their Power, Authority, and special Command,
is to address themselves to the <i>Stranger elect</i>, and
present, and deliver him from the Sovereign, the <i>Garter</i>,
<i>Mantle</i>, and other Ensigns of the Order: Where observe,
that there were four or five joined in a Commission,
as it has sometimes happened, then any five,
four, three, or two, were of the Quorum; whereof the
Principal of the Embassy was always one.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fourthly, They were impowered to require from the
<i>Stranger elect</i>, his Oath, according to the Form prescribed
in the <i>Statutes</i>; but this was a special case, and only inferred
in the Commissions of Legation to <i>Charles</i>, Duke
of <i>Burgundy</i>, 9 <i>Edw.</i> IV. and <i>Ferdinand</i>, Archdeacon of
<i>Austria</i>, 15 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. and omitted in all Commissions
since that time.</p>

<p class='c000'>And lastly, To perform, and dispatch those things,
which they should judge necessary, in the same manner
as if the Sovereign were present in Person; and this
Power it was thought fit to allow the Ambassadors, in
case any thing should want to be performed which their
Instructions had not sufficiently provided for.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first Embassy on this occasion, recorded in the
<i>Blue-Book</i>, is that to <i>Edward</i>, King of <i>Portugal</i>, 13 <i>Hen.</i> VI.
to whom, for the greater Dignity of the <i>Order</i>, Garter was
thought fit, by the <i>Chapter</i>, to be sent alone with the
<i>Habit</i> of the <i>Order</i>: And hence is the original of <i>Garter’s</i>
Claim to this Employment.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nevertheless, in succeeding times, as the Order grew
into Esteem, some one of the Knights-Companions was
made choice of by the Sovereign to be Principal in these
Legations; as were <i>Galliard Sieur de Duras</i>, sent to
<i>Charles</i>, Duke of <i>Burgundy</i>, 9 <i>Edw.</i> IV., <i>Arthur Plantagenet</i>,
Viscount <i>Lisle</i>, to <i>Francis</i> the first King of <i>France</i>,
19 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. and others.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sometimes other Noblemen, or Persons of Quality,
though not Knights-Companions, (yet correspondent to
the Degree of the <i>Stranger elect</i>, or to the Esteem the
present Interest begat in the Sovereign,) were employed
chief in these Embassies; among whom Sir <i>Charles Somerset</i>,
after Earl of <i>Worcester</i>, was sent to the Emperor <i>Maximilian</i>,
6 <i>Hen.</i> VII. <i>Henry</i>, Lord <i>Morley</i>, to <i>Don Ferdinand</i>,
Prince of <i>Spain</i>, 15 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. and others.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='370' id='Page_370'></span>In Embassies of this nature, it was heretofore usual, to
join some Persons of Rank and Quality, or Office near
the Sovereign, in the Commission; as Sir <i>John Scot</i>, Comptroller
of the Houshold, and Sir <i>Thomas Vaughan</i>, Treasurer
of the Houshold, both joined with the <i>Sieur de Duras</i>
aforesaid: And Sir <i>Nicholas Carew</i>, and Sir <i>Anthony Brown</i>,
with the Viscount <i>Lisle</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>To these Person, the Sovereign thought fit sometimes
to add a Doctor of the Law, or a dignified Clergyman,
and such as had the Language of the Country, not only
the better to make such Answers to Questions as the
<i>Stranger elect</i> might start, on perusal of the <i>Statutes</i>, but
likewise to inform him touching the Institution of the
<i>Order</i>, or other Passages relating to the Founder, or
matters touching the Honour of the Garter. Besides,
a dignified Clergyman was in those Times thought
proper to Administer the Oath, and pronounce the Words
of Signification, at the Investiture with the Habit and
Ensigns of the <i>Order</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>And for these reasons, was <i>John Russel</i>, Doctor of the
Civil Law, and Archdeacon of <i>Berkshire</i>, joined in Commission
with the aforesaid <i>Sieur de Duras</i>, and <i>Edward
Lee</i>, Doctor in Divinity, Archdeacon of <i>Colchester</i>, and
the Sovereign’s Almoner, sent over with the Lord <i>Morley</i>;
and others.</p>

<p class='c000'>But of later Years the Sovereign’s Ambassador, Resident
with the <i>Stranger elect</i>, hath supplied this Place; as did
Sir <i>Thomas Smith</i>, in the Legation sent over to <i>Charles</i> IX.
and Sir <i>Edward Stafford</i>, in that of the <i>French</i> King <i>Henry</i> III.
and Sir <i>Anthony Mildmay</i>, to that of <i>Henry</i> IV.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides the aforementioned Persons, <i>Garter</i> was always
joined in these Commissions of Legation, not only to keep
on Foot his Right, but to manage the Ceremonious Part;
and of this there are so many numerous Instances as are
sufficient to justify the Privilege of his Office, and maintain
the interest of an ancient Right. Besides which, if
it were any way disputed, we find it decreed in a <i>Chapter</i>
13 <i>Car.</i> I. <i>That the carrying the Ensigns of the Order to</i>
Stranger Princes, <i>doth properly belong to</i> Garter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides those Persons joined in the Commission of Legation,
there has frequently been appointed, either <i>Norroy</i>,
King of Arms, or some one of the <i>Heralds</i>, to go in
Quality of an Attendant in this Service, not only for the
<span class='pageno' title='371' id='Page_371'></span>Honour of the Sovereign, but of the Stranger who is to
receive the <i>Habit</i>, in regard the Ceremonies of Investiture
with the whole <i>Habit</i>, require the Assistance of two Officers
of Arms, of which there are some Precedents.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Lancaster Herald</i> attended the Embassy to <i>Charles</i> IX.
King of <i>France</i>: <i>Chester Herald</i>, and <i>Rouge Dragon</i>,
Pursuivant at Arms, on that of <i>Henry</i> III. of <i>France</i>. A
Herald likewise attended the Embassy to <i>Emanuel</i>, Duke
of <i>Savoy</i>: <i>York Herald</i>, that of <i>Maximilian</i>, the Emperor:
And <i>Somerset Herald</i>, to <i>Henry</i> IV. of <i>France</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>And whereas there went only <i>Norroy</i> to <i>Christian</i> IV.
King of <i>Denmark</i>, it was because no more of the Officers
of Arms could then be spared from their necessary
Attendance on the Sovereign’s Coronation; so in the Embassy
to <i>Maurice</i>, Prince of <i>Orange</i>, one Herald sufficed,
because the <i>Garter</i> and <i>George</i> only were sent him, and
consequently there was but little Service then to be performed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Concerning other Companions, and Attendants, in these
Legations, they are both for Quality and Number such,
and so many, as the chief in the Legation judges sufficient
for the Honour of the Sovereign, and the Dignity of the
Embassy; and with these have usually gone several Noblemen,
Knights, and Gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the third Place, there is to be prepared for these Legations,
Warrants for the Habit and Ensigns of the <i>Order</i>;
and these are also to be drawn up by the Chancellor of the
<i>Order</i>, who is to attend the Sovereign for his Sign Manual
thereto.</p>

<p class='c000'>One Warrant is to be directed to the Master of the
<i>Great Wardrobe</i>, to deliver to Garter the Mantle, with
the Escutcheon of St. <i>George</i> within a Garter, embroidered
on the left Shoulder, and Tossels belonging; and also the
<i>Surcoat</i> and <i>Hood</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is also another Warrant drawn up, for the delivery
of the Ensigns of the <i>Order</i> to <i>Garter</i>, <i>viz.</i> the rich
<i>Garter</i>, and great <i>Collar</i> of the <i>Order</i>, with a George Pendant,
and another George hanging in a blue Ribbond;
together with Cases for them, lined with purple Velvet,
and gilt on the outside.</p>

<p class='c000'>And sometimes these Ensigns have been delivered out
of the <i>Jewel-House</i>, to the Herald of Arms, joined in the
Legation in <i>Garter’s</i> stead, as were those sent to <i>Charles</i>,
<span class='pageno' title='372' id='Page_372'></span>King of <i>Sweden</i>, 20 <i>Car.</i> II. but those provided for <i>John
George</i>, Duke of <i>Saxony</i>, to Sir <i>Thomas Higgons</i>, the Principal
in the Legation; for which they gave their several
Receipts.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sovereign’s Warrant for the delivery of the Ensigns
sent to <i>Maximilian</i> the Emperor, was directed to
the Lord Treasurer, for which <i>Garter</i> gave his Receipt.
But for those sent to the <i>French</i> King, <i>Henry</i> IV. the
Warrant was directed to the Master of the <i>Jewel-House</i>;
and out of this Office have all the <i>Ensigns</i> of the <i>Order</i>
been since delivered.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are several other necessaries to be provided,
which may pass as Appurtenances to the former, and are
sometimes incerted in the Sovereign’s Warrants for the
Habit of the <i>Order</i>, and at other times issued by particular
Warrants: As a black Velvet Cap with white Feathers
and a Heron Sprig, a Girdle and Hangers with the same
coloured Velvet, with the Surcoat. A Yard of purple Velvet
hath usually been allowed out of the <i>Great Wardrobe</i>,
for covering the Book of <i>Statutes</i>, sent to the <i>elect Stranger</i>:
And for the Velom, Writing and Binding the said Book,
there is a Fee paid by the Sovereign to the <i>Register</i> of the
<i>Order</i>, which hath generally been proportioned to the Dignity
of the Receiver; for this Officer had allowed him
for the Book sent,</p>

<p class='c008'>This Book of <i>Statutes</i> ought to be Sealed with the common

but all the other succeeding Bodies of <i>Statutes</i> appoint.
Besides, at a Chapter held at <i>White-Hall</i>, 13 <i>Car.</i> I. the
Law was confirmed; and thereupon it was again decreed,
That the Book of <i>Statutes</i> sent to any <i>Stranger Prince</i>,
should be Sealed with the Great Seal of the <i>Order</i>, affixed
to a Label of blue Silk and Gold.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is also to be provided a large purple Velvet
Cushion, to carry the Robes on, when they are to be presented;
this is likewise put into the Sovereign’s Warrant,
and provided by the Master of the <i>Great Wardrobe</i>;
usually containing one Yard and quarter in length, adorned
with Fringe, Cauls, and Tossels of Gold and purple
Silk, and within it a Pillow of Fustian filled with Down.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were two Velvet Cushions prepared for the Service
of the Duke of <i>Wirtembergh</i>’s Investiture, 1 <i>Jac.</i> I.
one of Purple, for the Sovereign’s State; and another of
Crimson, for the Duke; so the same Year to <i>Christian</i> IV.
King of <i>Denmark</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two <i>Majesty Escutcheons</i> are likewise to be provided,
painted in <i>Oil</i>, and gilt with Gold; one to have the Arms
of the Sovereign surrounded with a Garter, under an Imperial
Crown; the other of the <i>Stranger’s</i> Arms, within
a Garter also, and such a Crown as is proper to his Dignity.
Both these are to be put in Frames, painted and
gilt, with their several Stiles fairly Written under the
Arms, and set on the back of the Sovereign’s Stall, under
the State, as also on the back of the Stall of the <i>Stranger
elect</i>: But there were three <i>Majesty Escutcheons</i> sent over
in the Legation to <i>Henry</i>, Prince of <i>Orange</i>, in regard
that at his Investiture, <i>Frederick</i>, Elector Palatine, was present.
<span class='pageno' title='374' id='Page_374'></span>In case the chief Person in the Legation be a

their Diet, and Reward, during their Journey, and till
their return; and on which, most commonly, for greater
certainty of its Payment, the Sovereign’s Privy Seal is
obtained.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Allowance to <i>Garter</i> in the Reign of <i>Edw.</i> VI.
was ten Shillings a Day for his Diet, and Ten Shillings a
Day more as a Reward: And this we find allowed to
Sir <i>Gilbert Dethick</i>, in the Embassy to <i>Henry</i> II. King of
<i>France</i>, 5 <i>Edw.</i> VI. and the like in his Legation to
<i>Maximilian</i> the Emperor; and to <i>Frederick</i> II. King
of <i>Denmark</i>, 24 <i>Eliz.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>And when <i>Clarenceux</i> was sent in the Place of <i>Garter</i>
(the Office being void by the Death of the said Sir <i>Gilbert</i>)
to the <i>French</i> King, <i>Henry</i> III. the same was also allowed
him, and commenced nine Days before his setting out;
and of which there are other Precedents.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of this daily Allowance, <i>Garter</i> hath usually obtained
an advance before-hand, for his better support by the
way.</p>

<p class='c000'>When any of the Heralds were sent in <i>Garter’s</i> Place,
the same Allowances were made them, as if <i>Garter</i> had
gone in Person; as had <i>Henry St. George</i>, Esq; <i>Richmond
Herald</i>, sent with the Earl of <i>Carlisle</i>, to <i>Charles</i>, King of
<span class='pageno' title='375' id='Page_375'></span><i>Sweden</i>, 21 <i>Car.</i> I. As also to <i>Thomas St. George</i>, Esq;
<i>Somerset Herald</i>, sent with Sir <i>Thomas Higgins</i>, to the Duke
of <i>Saxony</i>, soon after.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the Allowance to such Officers of Arms, as are
not joined in, but appointed to attend any of these Legations;
it was usually, if a Herald, the Moiety of what
was given to <i>Garter</i>: And if a Pursuivant at Arms, half
as much as a Herald.</p>

<p class='c000'>Agreeable to which, was the Allowance given to <i>Chester
Herald</i>, and <i>Rouge Dragon</i> Pursuivant, in the Embassy to
<i>Henry</i> II. King of <i>France</i>, 5 <i>Edw.</i> VI. and there called
the <i>old Rate</i>; so also to <i>Somerset Herald</i>, to <i>Frederick</i> II.
King of <i>Denmark</i>, and the <i>French</i> Kings, <i>Henry</i> III. and
IV. And both the Herald and Pursuivant had also a proportionable
part of their daily Allowances before-hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides which Allowances mentioned, <i>Garter</i> hath also
Allowance for Postage, both Outward and Homeward,
for Himself and Servants; and for Transportation of the
Habit, and other Things necessary for the Voyage. And
this by a Clause added in the Sovereign’s Warrant, is
left to <i>Garter</i> at his return, when he gives in a Bill of
particulars, subscribed with his Hand, to the Treasurer or
Chamberlains of the Exchequer, to have been disbursed
by him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Warrant to furnish <i>Garter</i>, or the <i>Herald</i>, with Post
Horses, and convenient Shipping to carry them over, is
usually had of the Privy Council, or Secretary of State;
either before, or after the Lord Ambassador; and is not
provided for in the same Ship.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>The Ceremonies of Investiture.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 3. The Ceremonies performed at a Stranger Prince’s
Receipt of the whole Habit and Ensigns of the Order,
are highly Solemn, whether we consider the manner of
Investiture performed by the Sovereign’s Ambassadors, on
the <i>Festivity</i> and <i>Triumphs</i>, added by the new invested
Prince.</p>

<p class='c000'>First, the Commissions joined in the Legation, receiving
notice of their first Audience, are to present themselves in
the accustomed manner of Ambassadors, Garter, or his
Deputy, going in breast with the chief of the Legation,
<span class='pageno' title='376' id='Page_376'></span>if there be only himself joined in Commission with the
Lord Ambassador, and in this Place <i>William Segar</i>, Esq;
<i>Norroy</i> King of Arms, (sent in the room of <i>Garter</i>) proceeded
with the Earl of <i>Rutland</i> at their first Audience before
<i>Christian</i>, IV. King of <i>Denmark</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Being arrived near the <i>elect Stranger</i>, they present the
Letters, certifying Election, or their Credential Letters
from the Sovereign; and after some short general Compliment
by the Ambassador, he makes known to him,
his Election in the usual Form, which is before sufficiently
spoke of.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the Formality of this Address is over, and that
the Stranger hath by his Answer accepted of his Election,
and consented to the Reception of the <i>Order</i>; the Ambassador
immediately delivers him the Book of <i>Statutes</i>, that
he may, if he pleases, peruse them before he assume the
Habit, and desires his Consideration thereon. Next, both
the Commissioners in the Legation present him with the
<i>George</i> and <i>Ribbond</i>. and put it about his Neck, as in
several Instances hath been shown.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the interim, before the Day of Investiture, Time
is usually set apart for Conference between the Sovereign’s
Ambassador, and some of the elect Prince’s Council,
touching the ordering of the Ceremonies, and wording
the Oath to be by him taken. <i>Garter</i> is likewise to consider
what Places in the elect Prince’s Court are fit to perform
the Ceremony, and to see them made ready, and to
instruct his Officers, what Duties and Services they are to
undertake.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the great Hall, or other large Room, be appointed,
there ought to be prepared a Table, with a rich Carpet,
whereon the Habit and Ensigns of the <i>Order</i> are to be laid,
while the Sovereign’s Commission of Legation is read;
another Table should be prepared for the Stranger who
receives the <i>Order</i>; and a third for the Sovereign’s Ambassador.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Church or Chappel where they are to proceed
to hear Divine Service, a Stall is to be erected under a
Cloth of State, on the Right Hand Entrance of the Choir,
for the Sovereign of the <i>Order</i>, wherein is to be fixed the
<i>Majesty Escutcheon</i> of the Sovereign’s Arms; another Stall
is also to be placed on the same side of the Choir for the
invested Stranger, at the same distance from the Sovereign’s
<span class='pageno' title='377' id='Page_377'></span>Stall, as is that for the elect Stranger in the Choir
at <i>Windsor</i>; in which is to be fixt the <i>Majesty Escutcheon</i>
of his own Arms, brought likewise over by <i>Garter</i> or his
Deputy; a third Stall is to be erected for the Lord Ambassador,
who (if a <i>Knight-Companion</i>) hath an <i>Escutcheon</i>
of his own Arms within a <i>Garter</i> set over it; for so had
the Marquiss of <i>Northampton</i>, at the Investiture of the
<i>French</i> King, <i>Henry</i> II. <i>Anno</i> 5 <i>Edw.</i> VI. and the Earl of
<i>Derby</i>, at that of <i>Henry</i> III. under all these <i>Escutcheons of
Arms</i>, the Stiles and Titles (fairly Written) of the <i>Sovereign</i>,
and each <i>Knight-Companion</i>, are to be affix’d.</p>

<p class='c000'>Where there is no solemn Proceeding to Church, the
Sovereign’s <i>Escutcheon of Arms</i>, with his Titles, have been
set up at the upper end of the Room, where the Investiture
is performed; so also the Stranger Knight’s at due
distance, as at the Investiture of <i>Gustavus Adolphus</i>, King
of <i>Sweden</i>, in his Tent at the <i>Leaguer</i>, near <i>Darshaw</i>, in
<i>Prussia</i>, 23 <i>September</i>, <i>Anno</i> 3 <i>Car.</i> I.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides the before-mentioned Preparations; the <i>Church</i>
or <i>Chappel</i>, into which the new invested Stranger proceeds,
is to be richly adorned, as we find by several Instances;
as at the Investiture of King <i>Henry</i> III. when the Church
of <i>Augustine Fryars</i> in <i>Paris</i>, was hung with rich <i>Arras</i>,
and all the <i>Choir</i> and <i>Stalls</i> with <i>Cloth of Gold</i>. On the
Day the Solemnity of Investiture is celebrated, the elect
Stranger sends his Coach, and some Persons of Quality,
to Accompany the Sovereign’s Ambassadors to his Court.
At the Investiture of <i>Henry</i>, Prince of <i>Orange</i>, <i>Frederick</i>,
Prince Palatine of the <i>Rhine</i>, sat with the Viscount <i>Charleton</i>,
in one Boot of the Prince’s Coach, and Sir <i>William
Segar</i> in the other; and were met by the said Prince at
the Foot of the Stairs of his Court, and conducted thence
into his great Chamber.</p>

<p class='c000'>After such time as the elect Stranger, and the Sovereign’s
Ambassadors, have a while retired; the Stranger
usually first enters the Room appointed for the Ceremony,
and stands under his own State, expecting the coming
in of the Ambassadors, and notice thereof being given
them, they (reposing in a Room near) proceed in manner
following.</p>

<p class='c000'>Servants to the Lord Ambassador, two and two.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Herald in his Coat of Arms, bearing the Mantle,
Surcoat, Hood, and Cap, in his Arms; and if a <i>Pursuivant</i>
<span class='pageno' title='378' id='Page_378'></span>attend the Embassy, he (wearing his Coat) proceeds
before him, bearing part of the said Habit.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Garter</i> vested in his rich Coat of his Sovereign’s Arms,
also (but at the Investiture of the Duke of <i>Wirtemberg</i>,
he wore his Robe of Crimson Satten, as did <i>Clarenceux</i>,
at the Investiture of the <i>French</i> King, <i>Henry</i> III.) bearing
on a Cushion the <i>Garter</i>, and <i>Collar</i> of the <i>Order</i>, with the
great <i>George</i>, the Book of <i>Statutes</i>, and the Commission of
<i>Legation</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lastly, The Lord Ambassador, or chief in the Embassy,
who, if a <i>Knight-Companion</i>, proceedeth in his compleat
Habit.</p>

<p class='c000'>If any other <i>Knight-Companion</i> is present, he also wears
his whole Habit of the <i>Order</i>, as did the Constable of
<i>France</i>, at the Investiture of the <i>French</i> King, <i>Henry</i> II.
The said Constable also pair’d in the Proceeding with the
Sovereign’s Ambassador.</p>

<p class='c000'>In going up to the Sovereign’s State, they all make
three Reverences, and drawing near, the Ambassadors
Servants fall off on either side for the <i>Herald</i> to pass up
to the Table, set before the Sovereign’s State; whereon
(with a single Reverence) he lays the Robes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then <i>Garter</i> draws near the Table also, and with a like
Reverence towards the Sovereign’s State deposites the
<i>Ensigns</i> of the <i>Order</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Lord Ambassador follows, and makes his Reverence
towards the Sovereign’s State, and after turning to
the Stranger elect, and doing him Reverence, he (or some
other fit Person) delivers himself in a short, but grave, and
learned Oration; “in which he not only sets forth the
Praises of the illustrious <i>Order</i>, and of the King the Sovereign,
but also the Virtues, the memorable and
praise-worthy Actions of the elect Stranger, to whom
the Habit and Ensigns of the <i>Order</i> are sent: Neither
are his Ancestors (if any of them have attain’d the
Honour of this <i>Order</i>,) past over in Silence, that thereby
his Heart (already breathing impatience and desire,) may
be so much the more inflamed with an Earnestness to
obtain the Honour and Favour of this so great a Dignity.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He adds besides, that the Sovereign having well
weigh’d these and the like things in his Mind, and
maturely advis’d thereof with his <i>Knights-Companions</i>,
<span class='pageno' title='379' id='Page_379'></span>they were perswaded and well satisfied in themselves,
to nominate and chuse him before others; to the end
that he might both himself be honoured by the Choice
of such a Person, and also thereby give an increase and
addition of Lustre to those renowned Actions and Virtues,
which already were a chief Ornament to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lastly, He points towards the <i>Ensigns</i> of the <i>Order</i>,
which he declares to have been sent by the Sovereign,
out of great Love, and singular Affection, to dignify
him therewith, as to a Person to whom he wish’d as
well and honourably as to any other Prince whatsoever,
and withall intreats him kindly to accept thereof, and
wear them in remembrance of the Sovereign and his
<i>Order</i>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This or the like Oration being ended, the Ambassadors
present their Commission of <i>Legation</i> to the elect Stranger,
who delivers it to his Secretary, and he publickly Reads
it.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the before-mentioned Investiture of the <i>French</i> King,
<i>Henry</i> II. the Bishop of <i>Ely</i>, one of the Commissioners of
the <i>Legation</i>, made the Speech, to which the Cardinal of
<i>Lorrain</i> returned Answer in the said King’s behalf, with
all thankful Acknowledgments of the Honour of the
<i>Order</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the Commission is read, <i>Garter</i> presents the Oath
fairly Written, which is administred to the elect Stranger,
where, if any Exceptions were before made and admitted,
they must be rehears’d, as we find it directed in
the instructions given for the Investiture of <i>James</i> V. King
of <i>Scotland</i>. The Ceremony of the Oath being finish’d,
<i>Garter</i> takes from off the Cushion the Garter, and having
kiss’d it, presents it to the Lord Ambassador, who kneeling
down, puts it with all Reverence on the Stranger’s
left Leg, being assisted by <i>Garter</i>, who pronounces these
Words of <i>Signification</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Ad laudem atque honorem Omnipotentis Dei, intemeratæ
Matris ejus, &amp; Sancti Georgii Martyris; cinge tibiam
tuam hoc insigni Subligaculo, circumferens in augmentum
honoris tui, &amp; in signum ac memoriam illustrissimi
Ordinis, nusquam oblivioni daturus, aut omissurus, quod
eo moneris; ut valeas, inquam &amp; velis in justo bello,
quod solum inibis, stare firmiter, agere fortiter, &amp; feliciter
omnino vincere.</i></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='380' id='Page_380'></span>This being said, <i>Garter</i> takes the <i>Surcoat</i>, and with the
Ceremony of a Kiss, delivers it to the Lord Ambassador,
who (after the Stranger elect hath put off his Cloak
or upper Garment, and Sword,) puts it upon him in this
manner: First, The Lord Ambassador begins at the
Stranger’s Right Arm, and <i>Garter</i> (or the <i>Leiger Ambassador</i>
if present,) assists at the left Shoulder. The Stranger
being thus vested with the <i>Surcoat</i>, both the Lord
<i>Ambassador</i> and <i>Garter</i> gird his Sword about him, with
a Velvet Girdle of the same Colour, at the doing whereof
<i>Garter</i> saith these Words.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Capito vestem hanc purpuream, ad incrementum honoris,
&amp; in signaculum Ordinis accepti: qua munitus non veteberis
pro fide Christi, libertate Ecclesiæ, pro jure, &amp; oppressorum
atque indigentium necessaria tuitione, sanguinem
etiam fundere, nedum fortiter ac strenue dimicare.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>After this, <i>Garter</i> takes up the <i>Mantle</i> and <i>Hood</i>, which,
in like manner kissing, he delivers to the Lord Ambassador,
who invests the Stranger therewith, and lays the
Hood upon his right Shoulder; (the Train being given
into the Hands of some Noble Personage to be born up,)
<i>Garter</i> also pronouncing these Words.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Accipe Clamidem hanc Cœlici coloris, in signum Clarissimi
hujus Ordinis, &amp; in Augmentum etiam honoris tui,
rubeo Clypeo Dominicæ crucis, uti cernis, insignitam: ut
cujus virtute semper ac vigore protectus per Hostes tutus
abeas, eos ubique superare valeas, &amp; pro clarissimis denique
Meritis, post egregiam hanc hujus temporis Militiam,
ad æterna vereque Triumphalia gaudia pertingas.</i></p>

<p class='c000'><i>Garter</i>, in the last Place, takes up the <i>Collar</i>, and with a
Kiss also presents it to the <i>Lord Ambassador</i>, who placeth
it about the Stranger’s Shoulders, and <i>Garter</i> uttereth these
Words.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Torquem hunc in Collo deferes, ad augmentum honoris,
&amp; in signum quoque clarissimi ordinis a te suscepti, cum
imagine Sanctissimi Martyris, &amp; Christi Militis Georgii:
cujus præsidio suffultus, Mundi hujus tam prospera quam
adversa sic pertranseas, ut animæ pariter ac corporis hostibus
hic strenue devictis, non Temporariæ modo Militiæ
gloriam, sed &amp; perenis victoriæ palmam denique recipere
valeas.</i> Amen.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Ceremony of Investiture is finished, the <i>Lord
Ambassador</i> congratulateth the new invested Stranger in the
<span class='pageno' title='381' id='Page_381'></span>Sovereign’s Name, and in the Name of all the <i>Knights-Companions</i>,
and then delivers him his Velvet Cap, adorned
with white Plumes, and the Book of <i>Statutes</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Stranger being thus invested, stayeth a while in
the Room, where he received this Honour, with the Ambassador,
and after Complements of Congratulation between
them, he goeth to the Church in a solemn manner,
having the Train of his <i>Mantle</i> born up; at the Entrance
into the Church, all in the Procession make three Reverences,
the first towards the <i>High Altar</i>, the next towards
the Sovereign’s Stall, and the third towards the
new invested Stranger’s Stall.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>Lord Ambassador</i> proceedeth towards the Seat
assign’d for him, and stands before it till the Stranger hath
ascended his Stall, and after making his Reverences, (as
before) takes his; then <i>Garter</i> making the like Reverences,
sits down on a Chair, plac’d for him before the Sovereign’s
Stall.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the <i>Herald at Arms</i> ought to be often near the
Stranger, or else the <i>Lord Ambassador</i>, to inform them of
the <i>Order</i> of <i>Ceremony</i>, because <i>Garter</i> is obliged to attend
the Sovereign’s Royal Stall.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a solemn Anthem, <i>Garter</i> passeth in the middle
of the <i>Choir</i>, and by a Reverence, first to the invested
Stranger, and next to the <i>Lord Ambassador</i>, gives them
the Signal for descending, and being both come down,
<i>Garter</i> passeth up before the Stranger to the <i>High Altar</i>,
where he makes his Offering of Gold and Silver, being
accompanied with the <i>Lord Ambassador</i>, the <i>Herald</i> laying
the Cushion whereon he kneels when he Offers.</p>

<p class='c000'>But if a <i>Knight-Companion</i> be sent on this <i>Legation</i>,
then he proceeds first up to the <i>Altar</i>, preceeded by <i>Garter</i>,
and Offers for the Sovereign, which done, he returns
to his own Stall: Next, the invested Stranger proceeds
up, (preceeded as before,) Offers, and returns back to his
own Stall; afterwards the aforesaid <i>Knight-Companion</i>
proceeds up again, and Offers for himself: And in this
<i>Order</i> was the Offering made when the Emperor <i>Maximilian</i>
was invested at <i>Vienna</i>, <i>January</i> 4. <i>Anno</i> 10.
<i>Eliz.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>The new invested Stranger having offered, returns to
his Stall, and the <i>Lord Ambassador</i>, with three Reverences,
takes his Seat, the <i>Organs, &amp;c.</i> playing all the while:
<span class='pageno' title='382' id='Page_382'></span>When the solemn Service is finish’d, the Stranger descends
again from his Stall, and with the Proceeding before him,
returns in the same Order he came to the Room, where
he received his Investiture.</p>

<p class='c000'>It’s observable, that the Emperor <i>Maximilian</i>, out of
a compliance with the Protestant Religion, caused, on the
Day of his Investiture, all Prayers to Saints incensing, and
other Matters and Ceremonies not used by the Church
of <i>England</i>, to be wholly omitted at the Service in his
Chappel.</p>

<p class='c000'>At these great Solemnities, the invested Strangers have
heretofore held most magnificent Feasts, but of late they
are not so much in Use: And when Dinner was ready,
they proceeded thither in their whole Habit, which they
wore all Dinner time.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the Investiture of <i>Christian</i> IV. King of <i>Denmark</i>,
<i>Anno</i> 1 <i>Jac.</i> I. the Sovereign’s Stiles and Titles of Honour
were proclaimed thrice, (before they sat down to
Dinner,) and the said King’s twice; but when <i>Maurice</i>
and <i>Henry</i>, Princes of <i>Orange</i>, received Investiture, the
Stiles were proclaimed immediately after they were invested,
and in the same Room, the Ceremony being perform’d
to both in the Afternoon.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the Feast made by <i>Maximilian</i> I. (King of the <i>Romans</i>,)
Sir <i>Charles Somerset</i>, and Sir <i>Thomas Wriothesley</i>,
sent on the Embassy, was admitted to his Table, and sat
on his left Hand: On the Day of Investiture of <i>Don Ferdinand</i>,
Prince of <i>Spain</i>, Arch-Duke of <i>Austria</i>, the Lord
<i>Morley</i>, and Sir <i>William Hussey</i>, sat on his right Hand at
Dinner, and Dr. <i>Lee</i>, and the said Sir <i>Thomas Wriothesley</i>,
on his left; these four being join’d in the Commission of
<i>Legation</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>At a Feast on the like Occasion by the <i>French</i> King,
<i>Henry</i> II. he admitted to his Table (beside the Marquiss
of <i>Northampton</i>, the principal Person in the <i>Legation</i>,) the
before-mentioned Constable of <i>France</i>; and all three sat
in their full Robes of the <i>Garter</i>, which they put not off
till after Dinner. The Cardinal of <i>Lorrain</i> sat also at the
King’s Table, but it was on the other side.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Investiture was performed in the Afternoon,
then was the Grand Dinner turn’d into a Supper; as it
was at the Investiture of <i>Maximilian</i> the Emperor, and
two of the <i>French</i> Kings; but when <i>Henry</i>, Prince of
<span class='pageno' title='383' id='Page_383'></span><i>Orange</i>, receiv’d the <i>Ensigns</i> of the <i>Order</i>, there was no
Feast at all, but purposely omitted, to prevent the difference
which might have been occasioned by the Precedency
and Place, between Ambassadors drinking of Healths,
and other Complements.</p>

<p class='c000'>On this Solemnity, and the Honour they deriv’d from it,
some have thought fit to transmit the Memory to Posterity,
by Medals, with Inscriptions relating thereto; such were
those of Gold and Silver, which <i>Frederick</i>, Duke of <i>Wirtemberg</i>,
caused to be made; as also those made by <i>Charles</i>,
King of <i>Sweden</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Certificates of having receiv’d the</i> Habits, <i>and</i> Ensigns <i>of the</i> Order.</h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 4. The magnificent Solemnity of Investiture, <i>&amp;c.</i>
being compleatly finish’d, and the Ambassadors having
fully performed their Duties therein; they are yet further
to obtain from the new invested Stranger, before their
departure, a publick Instrument, testifying the reception
of the said Habit and Ensigns, Sign’d with his Hand, and
Sealed with his Great Seal; this we find anciently done
in several Instances, and is generally demanded and obtain’d.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hereupon a Clause to this Effect is usually added, in
Instructions given to Ambassadors; as appears from those
to the Lord <i>Howard</i> and <i>Garter</i>, in the Embassy to
<i>James</i> V. King of <i>Scotland</i>; namely, that <i>Garter should
remember</i> (after the Investiture was performed,) <i>to Purchase,
and Sollicit a Certificate from the said King, of his reception
of the Order, and taking the Oath, both under his
Seal</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Form and Substance of these Certificates are much
alike; for after a recital of all the Powers given to the
Ambassadors nam’d in the Commission of <i>Legation</i>, the
Stranger Prince first makes Certificate of his receiving,
and Investiture with the <i>Mantle</i>, <i>Surcoat</i>, <i>Collar</i>, and
other Ornaments of the <i>Order</i>; and that they receiv’d
them from the Sovereign’s Ambassador, with the accustom’d
Solemnities.</p>

<p class='c000'>In some of these Certificates, namely from <i>Ferdinand</i>,
Prince of <i>Spain</i>, <i>Anno</i> 15 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. from <i>Francis</i> I.
<span class='pageno' title='384' id='Page_384'></span>the <i>French</i> King, <i>Anno</i> 19 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. and from <i>Gustavus</i>,
King of <i>Sweden</i>, <i>Anno</i> 3 <i>Car.</i> I. we find the taking the
Oath appointed by the Statutes to be also certified. Of
the return of these Certificates, the Annals of the <i>Order</i>
sometimes take notice, and by a Decree, 13 <i>Car.</i> I. care
was taken to oblige the Ambassadors to produce these Certificates
to the Sovereign at their return.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Stranger Prince hath been pleas’d sometimes, to
give with the Certificate, a particular Testimonial of <i>Garter</i>’s
punctual discharge of his Duty in the <i>Legation</i>, or of
the Officer of Arms employed in his stead; as did <i>Gustavus</i>,
King of <i>Sweden</i>, in the preamble of his <i>Diploma</i>,
whereby he testifies the bestowing upon <i>Henry St. George</i>,
<i>Richmond Herald</i>, the Honour of Knighthood; they have
also usually given <i>Garter</i> Gratuities, either in Money,
Diamonds, or some other Present of great value, of which
several Instances might be produced.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch16' class='c005'>CAP. XVI.<br /> <br /><i>The Installation of a Stranger by Proxy.</i></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Touching the Choice and Nomination of a Proxy.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 1.</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_6_0_7 c009'>After
the Stranger is invested, he is enjoin’d
by the Statutes (be he of what State or
Condition soever,) to send in eight Months
after his Investiture, either a <i>Proctor</i> or <i>Deputy</i> to be installed
in his behalf, in the Seat assign’d him within the
Chappel of St. <i>George</i> at <i>Windsor</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Time limited for sending in <i>Henry</i> Vth’s Statutes,
is but seven Months; and those of <i>Henry</i> VIII. allow no
more; and that not only after Investiture, but after the
Stranger hath certified the Sovereign of his reception of
the <i>Order</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>By King <i>Henry</i> VIIIth’s Statutes, it’s also provided;
<i>That in case a Stranger do not send his</i> Deputy <i>or</i> Proctor
<i>within seven Months, without having a reasonable Excuse,
and such as should be allowed by the Sovereign or his Deputy,
<span class='pageno' title='385' id='Page_385'></span>the Election</i> (notwithstanding his former Acceptation,)
<i>should be also void, except so it be, that the Stranger be
hindred or disturbed by great Affairs, and then might he
send his Excuse to the Sovereign, or his Deputy, within one
Month after; and according as the Sovereign or his Deputy
should allow or disallow of his Excuse, that then the Sovereign
or his Deputy might give unto him four Months of respite
more; within which time, if he neither come, nor
send his Deputy to be installed for him, then the said
Election should be void for that time</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>French</i> King, <i>Francis</i> I. was so earnest for compleating
this Honour, that he dispatch’d his Proctor hither
with all the speed he could, and most of the Stranger
Princes have sent their <i>Deputies</i> within the limited time,
there being very few Instances to the contrary, and those
were occasioned through the multiplicity of Affairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the <i>Garter</i> and <i>George</i> only have been sent to a
Stranger, the Ceremony of Installation hath been dispenc’d
with, till a more convenient time, as appears from the
Instructions of <i>March</i> 4. <i>Anno</i> 19 <i>Car.</i> I. given at the
sending these two principal <i>Ensigns</i> of the <i>Order</i>, to <i>William</i>,
Prince of <i>Orange</i>, and <i>Bernard de Foix</i>, Duke <i>d’Espernon</i>,
(in regard of the Interruptions then given by the
Rebellion here,) such dispensations, and for the same reason,
was King <i>Charles</i> II. necessitated to give those Strangers
whom he honoured with Election, while he remain’d
in Foreign Parts.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon the said King’s happy Restauration, among many
other things relating to the <i>Order</i>, this particular was taken
into consideration, in reference not only to the Duke <i>de
Espernon</i> and Prince <i>Maurice</i>, who were dead, but those
Strangers also then living; and at two <i>Chapters</i> held at
<i>White-Hall</i>, <i>Anno</i> 13 <i>Car.</i> II. directions were given to
<i>Garter</i> to place the <i>Banners</i> and <i>Atchievements</i> of the surviving
Strangers over their respective Stalls; and the Sovereign,
by his supream Power, (induc’d by the impossibilities
of the late Troubles to perform the Installation,
and by reason of the time elaps’d since their Elections,)
dispenc’d wholly and absolutely with their Installations,
but at the same time declar’d, that as the like necessity
and conjuncture could never happen again, so he
would not, on any motion or pretence whatsoever, give
the like dispensation.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='386' id='Page_386'></span>It seems to rest in the pleasure of the Stranger, whether
he will chuse to send over any Person of his own
Court, or give his Procuration to some one of the Sovereign’s
Subjects, to receive his Stall, and in his Name
to take Possession of it; the latter of which hath been
done several times, out of desire to favour some of our
Nobility with this Honour, of which many instances
might be given.</p>

<p class='c000'>It hath sometimes happned, that a <i>Proctor</i> for the Installation
of a Stranger, hath been appointed and nominated
by the Sovereign of the <i>Order</i>, though the Principal
had nam’d another before: Thus it fell out in the case of
<i>Maurice</i>, Prince of <i>Orange</i>, <i>Anno</i> 10 <i>Jac.</i> I. who having
deputed Count <i>Henry</i> his Brother, to be installed for him,
and he having put to Sea in Order thereto, but by reason
of contrary Winds not arriving in <i>England</i> before the Day
appointed for his Installation, the Sovereign and <i>Knights-Companions</i>
ordered that <i>Lodowick</i> of <i>Nassau</i>, Kinsman to
the elect Prince, should take Possession of his Stall on his
behalf: A case somewhat like, was that of <i>John George</i>,
Duke of <i>Saxony</i>, who sent over his Procuration to <i>John</i>,
Earl of <i>Bath</i>; and he being detained in the West on extraordinary
Occasions, when St. <i>George</i>’s Feast was held
at <i>Windsor</i>, <i>Anno</i> 23 <i>Car.</i> II. wrote to the <i>Chancellor</i> of
the <i>Order</i>, to obtain the Sovereign’s Dispensation, for
not appearing in the Name of his Principal; who representing
his humble request to the Sovereign, in a <i>Chapter</i>
held on the Eve of the said Feast, he was pleas’d to grant
it, and appointed <i>Heneage</i>, Earl of <i>Winchelsea</i>, who perform’d
the Service. There is also an ancient Example
of this kind, <i>Anno</i> 9 <i>Hen.</i> V. where the Sovereign nominated
the Lord <i>Fitz Hugh</i>, <i>Proctor</i> for the King of <i>Denmark</i>;
which yet was not done, till after the Sovereign
had been certified that the said King had been invested,
and obliged himself by Oath to the observation of the
<i>Statutes</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In like manner it is recorded, that the Earl of <i>Cleveland</i>
was by the Sovereign appointed Deputy for the Installation
of <i>Gustavus Adolphus</i>, King of <i>Sweden</i>, and yet not
unlike, but this might be with consent of the said King,
though the Annals herein are silent.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' title='387' id='Page_387'></span>
<h3 class='c010'><i>The Proctor’s Qualifications.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>§ 2. By the Statutes of the <i>Order</i>, the <i>Proctor</i>, whether
he be nominated by his Principal, or by the Sovereign,
must be <i>Procurator sufficiens &amp; Idoneas</i>; that is, such a
Person who hath always been accounted of unblameable
Conversation, not branded with any note of Infamy, but
altogether irreprovable. And such was <i>Dominicus Franciscus</i>,
<i>Deputy</i> to <i>Charles</i>, Duke of <i>Ferrara</i>, who in the
<i>Black-Book</i> of the <i>Order</i> is characterized to be a Knight of
incorrupt Fame; nor are we to doubt but that other
<i>Proctors</i> to Strangers were such, though the Testimonials
of their Virtues do not appear in the Annals of the
<i>Order</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Secondly, The <i>Proctor</i> ought to be a Person correspondent
to the State and Dignity of the Stranger that is
invested, which may sufficiently appear by several Instances;
the Emperor <i>Maximilian</i> I. appointed for his
Proxy, the Marquiss of <i>Brandenburgh</i>, <i>Anno</i> 6 <i>Hen.</i> VII.
<i>Francis</i> I. King of <i>France</i>, <i>Adrian de Fercelin</i>, Lord of
<i>Bross</i>, <i>Anno</i> 19 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. and <i>Henry</i> IV. of <i>France</i>, <i>Sieur
de Chastes</i>, Vice Admiral of <i>France</i>, <i>Anno</i> 42 <i>Eliz.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>Thirdly, It is provided that he be a Knight, and without
any manner of Reproach; and if it so happen that
he have not receiv’d the degree of Knighthood, the Sovereign
is to bestow that Honour before he be allow’d to
take upon him the Execution of his deputative Power;
for none but Knights are capable of this Honour, or permitted
to bear the <i>Ensigns</i> of so great an <i>Order</i>. Hereupon
the Lord <i>Willoughby</i> of <i>Eresby</i>, <i>Proctor</i> for <i>Frederick</i> II.
King of <i>Denmark</i>, was Knighted by the Sovereign, the
Morning before he proceeded to take Possession of the
Stall.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was one reason notwithstanding, why this particular
was not strictly stood upon, (though moved)
in the case (and it’s the single case) of <i>Henry Ramell</i>,
Hereditary Lord of <i>Wosterwitz</i> and <i>Beckeskaw</i>, <i>Deputy</i> for
<i>Christian</i> IV. King of <i>Denmark</i>, <i>Anno</i> 3 <i>Jac.</i> I. for it
being taken notice of that he was not a Knight, certain
Persons were sent from the Sovereign to signify his Pleasure,
that he should be advanc’d to the Honour of Knighthood
<span class='pageno' title='388' id='Page_388'></span>before he took upon him the <i>Ensigns</i> of the <i>Order</i>
in his King’s behalf; to which he made Answer, that
he appeared here, not in his own, but in the Name of
the King of <i>Denmark</i>; and that such a degree of Honour
was unusual in his own Country, (being Born in <i>Pomerania</i>,)
and therefore humbly desired that he might be
excus’d from the Honour; upon which the Sovereign
was pleas’d to dispence with him, and forthwith the said
<i>Deputy</i> (but no Knight,) was admitted to take the Stall
assign’d to the said King his Principal.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>His Letters of Procuration.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 3. The Authority wherewith an elect Stranger invests
his Proxy, which ought to pass under his Hand and
Seal, do generally contain these Particulars.</p>

<p class='c000'>First, He premiseth the Sovereign’s Election of him into
the Order of the <i>Garter</i>, and his receipt of the Habit
and Ensigns thereof, then takes notice or the Obligation
the <i>Statutes</i> of the Order put upon him, for sending a
Proxy to take Possession of his Stall, in regard the Dignity
whereunto he is advanc’d in his own Country, will
not permit him to repair Personally to <i>Windsor</i>; and being
not only desirous that the Election and Investiture
should obtain its due effect, but to fulfil, as far as in him
lies, the Injunctions of the <i>Statutes</i>, in what concerns the
assuming of his Stall, and taking the Oath appointed; he
therefore Ordains, Authorises, and Deputes, a Person
fitly qualified, (named in the Deputation,) his sufficient
<i>Proctor</i>, and special <i>Deputy</i>, to appear at the Castle of
<i>Windsor</i> in his behalf and in his Name, at the next Solemnity
that should be held there, to supply his room,
and receive Possession of the Stall assign’d him, according
to the usual Form; and in all respects to perform those
Ceremonies and Things in his behalf due and accustom’d,
or should appear to belong any way to the Splendor or
Ornament of the Order: As also to take the accustomed
Oath with those Qualifications, and in that Form as had
been (or should be) agreed on; and further, to fulfil all
other things which he should think necessary to be perform’d
on this Occasion, or whatsoever thing might require
a more special Command, than was contain’d in the Letters
<span class='pageno' title='389' id='Page_389'></span>of Procuration; and as fully as the Stranger should
be obliged to, and would do, if he were there present in
his own Person. Lastly, there is usually added a Clause
of Ratification and Confirmation, of all such things as the
<i>Proctor</i> should say or do, in reference to the Solemnity of
installation.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Of the Proctor’s Reception.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 4. When the Sovereign is acquainted with the arrival
of the Proxy, and the occasion of his coming, he
soon after gives him Audience; after which, a Day for
Installation is assign’d, and the Sovereign nominates some
of the <i>Knights-Companions</i> his Commissioners, to perform
the Ceremonies.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>Proctor</i> heretofore has been receiv’d with very
great State; Sir <i>Balthasar Castilian</i>, sent hither from the
Duke of <i>Urbin</i>, <i>Anno</i> 22 <i>Hen.</i> VII. was met at the Sea-side
by Sir <i>Thomas Brandon</i>, with a goodly Company of
his own Servants well Hors’d, who kept Company with
him, till they came near <i>Deptford</i> in <i>Kent</i>; where, by the
Sovereign’s Command, he was met by Sir <i>Thomas Dokara</i>,
and Sir <i>Thomas Wriothesley</i>, <i>Garter</i>: The said Sir <i>Thomas
Dokara</i> had attending him thirty of his Servants, all in
new Liveries, well Hors’d, every Gentleman bearing a
Javelin in his Hand, and every Yeoman a Bow and a
Sheaf of Arrows, and so they convey’d him to his Lodging.
The next Day they conducted him to <i>London</i>, and
by the way there met him divers <i>Italians</i>, and <i>Paulus de
Gygeles</i>, the Pope’s Vice Collector, to whose House he was
convey’d and lodg’d. The reception also of <i>James</i> Lord
<i>Rambovillet</i>, Proctor for the <i>French</i> King, <i>Charles</i> IX. was
very noble.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>The Preparations for Installation.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 5. The Preparations of the Installation of a Stranger
by Proxy, are the same as for the Proxy of a <i>Knight-Subject</i>,
mention’d as before, and the Form of the Commission
for Installation is much the same; the Preamble
<span class='pageno' title='390' id='Page_390'></span>contains the Authority wherewith the Proxy is impower’d
and is penn’d with like Words.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Letters of notice to the Commissioners.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Warrants for removing of Stalls, and for the
Strangers Atchievements, are all to be obtain’d by the
Chancellor of the Order, under the Sovereign’s Sign Manual,
to which the Signet of the Order is to be affixt.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Strangers Atchievements (as mention’d in the
Warrant,) are to be provided at the Sovereign’s Charge;
namely, his <i>Helm</i>, <i>Crest</i>, <i>Mantlings</i>, and <i>Sword</i>, together with
a <i>Banner</i> of his <i>Arms</i> and <i>Quarterings</i>; and these the
Proctor is enjoin’d to bring along with him to <i>Windsor</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sometimes a Warrant hath been directed to the Master
of the <i>Wardrobe</i>, to provide but some part of these Atchievements;
and another Warrant to the Lord Treasurer
of <i>England</i>, to deliver <i>Garter</i> Money to provide the
other part; in each of which, the particulars relating to
either are enumerated; for so were the Warrants drawn
up for the Atchievements of the <i>French</i> King, <i>Henry</i> II.
At other times direction hath been to the Master of the
<i>Wardrobe</i>, to deliver to <i>Garter</i> the whole, who thereupon
puts the Charge upon Account.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sometimes particular Warrants have been directed to
the Master of the <i>Wardrobe</i>, to deliver several Parcels of
the Materials, for the making up these Atchievements;
as were those Warrants, to deliver the Sovereign’s Embroiderer,
and to <i>Garter</i>, so much Velvet, Cloth of Gold,
<i>&amp;c.</i> for making the great Banner, and other the Atchievements
of <i>Charles</i> IX. and <i>Henry</i> III. <i>French</i> Kings.</p>

<p class='c000'>It also appears that <i>Garter</i> hath sometimes laid out the
Money for all, or part of the Atchievements, and then delivered
his Bill of disbursements into the <i>Wardrobe</i>; as is
manifest from those Bills for the Atchievements of <i>Frederick</i>
II. King of <i>Denmark</i>, in Count Palatine of the <i>Rhine</i>,
and the Duke of <i>Holstein</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides the Atchievements, some other things used at
the Solemnity are commonly included in the foresaid Warrants;
the <i>Mantle</i> of the <i>Order</i> is not prepared at the Sovereign’s
Charge, for the Statutes of Institution appoint the
Proxy to bring one with him, not that the Sovereign
should provide it, having done that before, at the Legation
with the whole <i>Habit</i>; nor is it found in the Rolls or
Books of the Sovereign’s great <i>Wardrobe</i>, that any Account
<span class='pageno' title='391' id='Page_391'></span>is made for providing a second <i>Mantle</i>, when the
Proxy of a Stranger came hither; which, had the Sovereign
been at such Charge, would not have been omitted.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>The Proctor</i>’s <i>Cavalcade to</i> Windsor.</h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 6. The Day appointed for the Installation drawing
on, the Proxy was heretofore accompanied from <i>London</i>
to <i>Windsor</i>, with the Sovereign’s Lieutenant and his Assistants,
(if the Feast of St. <i>George</i> was then also celebrated,)
or otherwise the Sovereign’s Commissioners with a
great Retinue.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the rest, when the Deputy of the <i>French</i> King,
<i>Francis</i> I. rode to <i>Windsor</i>, <i>Anno</i> 19 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. all the
<i>Knights-Companions</i> that were in Commission for that Solemnity,
assembled at the Lord <i>Sandy</i>’s Place near St.
<i>Paul</i>’s Church in <i>London</i>, whence they rode to the <i>Deputy’s</i>
Lodging, and thence accompanied him with a gallant
Equipage to the Castle of <i>Windsor</i>, where Lodgings were
prepared for him at the <i>Dean’s</i> House.</p>

<p class='c000'>In like manner, <i>Anno</i> 8 <i>Eliz.</i> the Earls of <i>Sussex</i> and
<i>Leicester</i>, and Lord <i>Clinton</i>, (three of the four Commissioners
appointed for the Installation of the <i>French</i> King,
<i>Charles</i> IX.) with other Lords and Gentlemen, took their
Horses at the Court Gate at <i>Westminster</i>, and with a great
Train rode to the Lodgings of the said King’s Proxy, (being
then at St. <i>Mary</i>’s <i>Spittle</i> in <i>London</i>,) whence they
went through <i>Holbourn</i> towards <i>Windsor</i>; the Earl of
<i>Southampton</i>, Viscount <i>Mountague</i>, Sir <i>Henry Lea</i>, and Sir
<i>Edward Umpton</i>, met them at <i>Langford</i> near <i>Colbrook</i>,
with their Hawks, and shew’d the Proxy variety of sport,
with which he being well pleased, they rode to his Lodgings
at the <i>Dean’s</i> House at <i>Windsor</i>, the usual Place of
entertaining the Strangers Proxies.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Supper after his Arrival there.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 7. The Evening of their arrival passeth with a sumptuous
Supper, but the principal Entertainment is reserv’d
for the following Day’s Dinner. At the Installation of the
<i>French</i> King, <i>Francis</i> I. all the Commissioners met together
<span class='pageno' title='392' id='Page_392'></span>at the Marquiss of <i>Exeter</i>’s Lodgings, and went to
the <i>Dean’s</i> House, where they were entertain’d by him
at Supper all at one Table; at another Table sat <i>Garter</i>,
with certain of the <i>Deputy’s</i> chief Gentlemen, and some
of the <i>Heralds</i>; and at a third sat the rest of the <i>Heralds</i>,
and other of the <i>Proxies</i> Servants.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Commissioners and other Noblemen, who accompanied
the <i>Proctor</i> of <i>Charles</i> IX. to <i>Windsor</i>, supped also
with him at the <i>Dean’s</i>; He himself sitting at the upper-end
of the Table; then the Earls of <i>Sussex</i> and <i>Leicester</i>
by him, one against the other, next the Earl of <i>Southampton</i>,
and Viscount <i>Mountague</i>, then the Lord <i>Clinton</i>, and
Lord <i>Herbert</i> of <i>Cardiff</i>, after them two Strangers of distinction,
then lower sat the Lord <i>Grey</i>, and other Strangers,
and last of all, at the lower end, opposite to the <i>Proctor</i>,
sat <i>Monsieur Dose</i>, <i>alias</i> St. <i>Michael</i>, the <i>French Herald</i>.
<i>Garter</i>, <i>Black-Rod</i>, and divers Strangers, supped
with the <i>Dean</i>, and in the Parlour and Hall sat divers
Pensioners, Gentlemen, and Strangers.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Of the Proceeding to the</i> Chapter-House.</h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 8. What hath been before set down of the Proceeding
to the <i>Chapter-House</i>, at the personal Installation of a
<i>Knight-Subject</i>, will extend hither, both as to Order
and Circumstances; yet this general Rule is to be born in
mind, that the Place of a Stranger Prince’s Proctor here,
is next after the Provincial King’s, (unless the Proctor of
a <i>Knight-Subject</i> happen to intervene,) and before the Junior
<i>Knight-Companion</i>, (unless a <i>Knight-Subject</i> pass then
in the Proceeding,) of which we have an Instance at the
Installation of the Dukes of <i>Brunswick</i> and <i>Chevereux</i>,
and the Earl of <i>Dorset</i>, by their Proctors, but the Earls of
<i>Salisbury</i>, <i>Carlisle</i>, and <i>Holland</i>, with Viscount <i>Andover</i>
in Person, <i>Anno</i> 1 <i>Car.</i> I. when the Proceeding was ordered
as followeth.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c002'>

      <div class='line'>14. Courtiers and Gentlemen in the Rear.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Only in the single case of <a id='christian' name='christian'></a><i>Christian</i> IV. King of <i>Denmark</i>,
<i>Anno</i> 3 <i>Jac.</i> I. (as an extraordinary Respect and
Honour,) his Proxy went in the Proceeding to the <i>Chapter-House</i>
next before the Sovereign’s Lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c000'>As we had a former Example, of a Proctor to a <i>Knight-Subject</i>,
who in this Proceeding past before the <i>Alms-Knights</i>,
and Officers of Arms, namely, Sir <i>Henry Sidney</i>,
<i>Deputy</i> to the Earl of <i>Warwick</i>, 5 <i>Eliz.</i> so here in the
case of a <i>Stranger</i>, the Viscount <i>Hereford</i>, Proxy to the
Duke of <i>Holstein</i>, installed 3 <i>Eliz.</i> went in this Proceeding
to the <i>Chapter-House</i>, before the Officers of Arms:
Which Proceeding was ordered as follows.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c002'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1. Gentlemen and Knights.</div>
      <div class='line'>2. The Proctor and Ambassador of <i>Holstein</i> together.</div>
      <div class='line'>3. Officers of Arms.</div>
      <div class='line'>4. Register and Garter.</div>
      <div class='line'>5. Lord <i>Hastings</i>, and Lord <i>Paget</i>, Commissioners.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>If the Proxy of a Stranger pass in the Proceeding, which
the Sovereign, his Lieutenant, or Commissioners, make
to the <i>Chapter-House</i>, then for the most part he gives his
Attendance in the <i>Presence-Chamber</i>, or in the Room
whence the Lieutenant or Commissioners proceed, and
there joins himself thereto.</p>

<p class='c000'>But sometimes the Commissioners, as an instance of
singular Respect, after their setting out, have taken the
Proxies Lodging in their way, and there receiv’d him into
the Proceeding; so did Prince <i>Henry</i>, by the Proctor
of <i>Christian</i> IV. King of <i>Denmark</i>; and the Commissioners
by the Proctor of the Duke of <i>Wirtembergh</i>, 2
<i>Jac.</i> I.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='394' id='Page_394'></span>’Tis observed, that the Proxies of Strangers have not
always gone in the Proceeding, but sometimes staid at their
Lodging, till the Commissioners were ready to send for
them to the <i>Chapter-House</i>. As at the Installation of
<i>Charles</i> IX. King of <i>France</i>, 8 <i>Eliz.</i> the Commissioners
meeting, they, and the three inferior Officers of the Order,
robed themselves, and then went to the Proxies
Lodging, and having just conferr’d with him, took leave,
and proceeded to the <i>Chapter-House</i>, whence they sent
out <i>Garter</i> to the Proxy, with invitation to come to them,
who was presently conducted by <i>Garter</i> to the <i>Chapter-House</i>
Door, where the two Senior Commissioners receiv’d
him between them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sometimes the Proxies have past privately to the East-Isle
of St. <i>George</i>’s Chappel, and there rested, before the
Sovereign and <i>Knights-Companions</i> went into the <i>Chapter-House</i>,
or proceeded into the Choir, without entering
thereinto; for so did the Earl of <i>Cleveland</i>, and the Marquiss
of <i>Dorset</i>, Proxies to <i>Gustavus Adolphus</i>, King of
<i>Sweden</i>, and <i>Henry</i>, Prince of <i>Orange</i>, 4 <i>Car.</i> I. The like
Method was observed by the Earl of <i>Dover</i>, Proxy to
<i>Charles</i>, Prince Palatine, 9 <i>Car.</i> I. and by Sir <i>George
Cartaret</i>, Proxy to <i>Christian</i>, Prince of <i>Denmark</i>, 15 <i>Car.</i> II.
so also of the Earls of <i>Carlisle</i> and <i>Winchelsea</i>, Proxies to
<i>Charles</i>, King of <i>Sweden</i>, and <i>John George</i>, Prince Elector
of <i>Saxony</i>, 23 <i>Car.</i> II.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>The Ceremonies perform’d therein.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 9. When the Proceeding hath arrived at the <i>Chapter-House</i>
Door, the Sovereign, and <i>Knights-Companions</i>, or
the Lieutenant, <i>&amp;c.</i> with the Officers of the <i>Order</i> before
them, enter to hold their Consultation; the Stranger’s
<i>Proxy</i> being first requested to stay without, till his Deputation,
or Letters of Procuration are read, to the end
they may understand the effect thereof.</p>

<p class='c000'>To this purpose we find it directed, by an ancient Hand,
that where any Knight is installed by his Deputy, he ought
to stay without the Vestry, or <i>Chapter-House</i> Door, till he
be introduced by two <i>Knights-Companions</i>: So the Lord
<i>Paget</i>, one of the Commissioners for Installation of the
Duke of <i>Savoy</i>, when the Proceeding was come to the
<span class='pageno' title='395' id='Page_395'></span><i>Chapter-House</i> Door, acquainted his <i>Proxy</i> with this Custom
and Injunction, which he complied with.</p>

<p class='c000'>The East-Isle, behind the High Altar, is the usual Place
for <i>Proxies</i> to stay, till they are called into the <i>Chapter</i>,
as it is also for the <i>Deputies</i> of <i>Knights-Subjects</i>, where
Chairs and Cushions are prepared for this occasion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first thing done after the <i>Chapter</i> is opened, is
reading the Commission for <i>Installation</i>, by the <i>Register</i> of
the <i>Order</i>, (but if the Sovereign be present, no Commission
issues,) and next, the Letters of Procuration; this being
the most usual and proper Place for this Ceremony.</p>

<p class='c000'>However, at the <i>Installation</i> of the <i>French</i> King, <i>Francis</i>
I. by a very unusual compliance, the Commissioners
went from the <i>Chapter-House</i>, after they had called in and
invested the Earl of <i>Oxford</i>, with his <i>Surcoat</i> and <i>Hood</i>,
to the <i>Dean’s</i> House, where the <i>Proctor</i> was lodg’d, and
in a great Chamber there, shewed him the Sovereign’s
Commission, and in it the Authority for admitting him
into the Stall of his Lord and Master: Upon which the
<i>Proctor</i> presented them with his Procuration, which impowered
him to take Possession of it, and to perform what
Ceremonies related to it; which Instrument the <i>Register</i>
read before them. This being done, they all proceeded
to the Chappel; where entering, they waved their return
to the <i>Chapter-House</i>, and passed directly into the <i>Choir</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>After some time of Consultation in the <i>Chapter-House</i>,
the <i>Proxy</i> is sent for in thither by <i>Garter</i>, who conducts
him to the <i>Chapter-House</i> Door, and his Reception there
by the Commissioners is after the same manner as is
used to the <i>Knight elect</i>, or to his <i>Proxy</i>: But whether
he ought to enter the <i>Chapter-House</i>, or be admitted any
farther than the Door, or Porch thereof, and to pass thence
immediately into the <i>Choir</i>, hath been some Question;
because the Practice seems to have been sometimes one
way, sometimes another.</p>

<p class='c000'>All that we find to prohibit his Entrance therein, is
an Expression in the short Ceremonial of <i>Installation</i> of
Strangers by <i>Proxy</i>, entered in the <i>Black-Book</i>; where it
says—That the <i>Mantle</i> is to be laid on the <i>Proctor’s</i> right
Shoulder, in the Porch of the <i>Chapter-House</i>, <i>because he is
not to enter into it</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>And there are two Instances where the <i>Mantle</i> was delivered
to the <i>Proctor</i> at the <i>Chapter-House</i> Door; from
<span class='pageno' title='396' id='Page_396'></span>whence some may infer, that the Practice of those Times
was also agreeable to the aforesaid direction; namely,
that of the <i>Proctor</i> of the <i>French</i> King, <i>Francis</i> I. 19
<i>Hen.</i> VIII. where <i>Garter</i> stood at the <i>Chapter-House</i> Door,
with the <i>Mantle</i>, and as the Proceeding passed by, presented
it to the two Senior <i>Knights-Companions</i>, who
placed it upon the <i>Proctor’s</i> right Arm; and so of the <i>Proctor</i>
of <i>Emanuel</i>, Duke of <i>Savoy</i>, 1 and 2 <i>Phil.</i> and <i>Mar.</i>
who entered not into the <i>Chapter-House</i>, but had the
<i>Mantle</i> discussed at the Door.</p>

<p class='c000'>But these Instances, if duly weighed, cannot properly,
or with any Advantage, be alledged to prove the Assertion;
because the Affairs relating to both, receiv’d dispatch in
the <i>Proctors</i> Lodging a little before, and where the <i>Proctor</i>
himself was present, where the meeting of the Commissioners
and Proctor cannot be deemed less than a <i>Chapter</i>,
tho’ not held in the <i>Chapter-House</i>, from the Transactions
that passed there, <i>viz.</i> producing the Sovereign’s Warrant,
and the <i>Proctor’s</i> Instrument of Deputation, which were
both read before them by the <i>Register</i>, and the <i>Proctor</i>
accordingly admitted, which being finished, nothing relating
to the present purpose required their passing into the
<i>Chapter-House</i>, or remained to be done till they came into
the <i>Choir</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the general Practice runs strong on the contrary
side; for we find that the <i>Proctor</i> for <i>Charles</i> IX. King of
<i>France</i>, 8 <i>Eliz.</i> was met at the <i>Chapter-House</i> Door, by
the Earls of <i>Sussex</i> and <i>Leicester</i>, who took him in thither
between them, where, after the <i>Register</i> had read, as well
the Sovereign’s Commission for Installation, as his Letters
of Procuration, and the Commissioners had admitted him
<i>Deputy</i> for the said King, they all came forth, and laid his
Principal’s <i>Mantle</i> on his right Arm and Shoulder, the
Train whereof was born by the Earl of <i>Southampton</i>, assisted
by the Lord <i>Herbert</i> of <i>Cardiff</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again it is remarkable, 25 <i>Eliz.</i> that <i>Garter</i> conducted
the <i>Proxy</i> of <i>Frederick</i> II. King of <i>Denmark</i>, to the <i>Chapter-House</i>,
and at that Place the Earl of <i>Leicester</i>, and the
Lord <i>Hunsdon</i>, received and led him in: So also was
<i>Christian</i> IVth’s <i>Proxy</i> led thither, by the Earls of <i>Nottingham</i>
and <i>Dorset</i>. And in <i>Jac.</i> I. <i>Lodowick</i>, Count <i>Nassau</i>,
<i>Proctor</i> to <i>Maurice</i>, Prince of <i>Orange</i>, was called into the
<i>Chapter-House</i>, and there left, while the Sovereign, and
<span class='pageno' title='397' id='Page_397'></span><i>Knights-Companions</i>, proceeded into the <i>Choir</i>: Also in
like manner was Sir <i>George Cartaret</i>, <i>Proctor</i> to <i>Christian</i>,
Prince of <i>Denmark</i>, 15 <i>Car.</i> II. and the <i>Proctors</i> to the
King of <i>Sweden</i>, and Duke of <i>Saxony</i>, 23 <i>Car.</i> II.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor are these Instances, and the Practice in this latter
case, really derogatory to the Statutes, which, though they
prohibit the <i>Proxies</i> Entrance into the <i>Chapter-House</i>, yet
do not extend to any thing previous to the Installation,
but what may happen after; for the Article of the <i>Statutes</i>
having first directed the delivery of the <i>Mantle</i> to the
<i>Proxy</i>, and next the assumption of his <i>Principal’s Stall</i>, in
these Words, <i>Dictus Procurator Installatus</i>, it immediately
subjoins, <i>that from thenceforth</i>, that is, from the time of
Installation, <i>he shall neither wear the</i> Mantle, <i>nor enter into
the</i> Chapter, <i>nor have Voice there, by virtue of any Power
granted him</i>. All which are Prohibitions, plainly relating
to future Examples, and arising after the Ceremonies of Installation
are past, and not at all refering to what preceeds it.</p>

<p class='c000'>And it seems the Law hath been thus understood, in
regard the greater prevalence of Practice hath generally
attended it; for not only the <i>Proxies</i> of Strangers, as is
observed, but generally <i>Knights-Subjects</i>, have been called
into the <i>Chapter-House</i>, and there received the <i>Mantle</i>,
before they proceeded into the <i>Choir</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Ceremony of delivering the <i>Mantle</i> to the <i>Proctor</i>,
is performed by the Sovereign, his Deputy, or the Commissioners,
<i>Garter</i> presenting it to them; and the manner
of it was anciently, by putting it on the <i>Proxies</i> right Arm
or Shoulder, in the Name of his Lord and Master, there
to hold it till the End of Divine Service.</p>

<p class='c000'>But as there hath arisen some dispute, touching the
<i>Proctor’s</i> entry into the <i>Chapter-House</i> before Installation,
so it hath happened in this Point of receiving the <i>Mantle</i>,
<i>viz.</i> whether in the <i>Chapter</i>, or <i>Stall</i> allotted their <i>Principal</i>,
of which there are Examples.</p>

<p class='c000'>That part of the Article in the <i>Statutes</i> of <i>Institution</i>,
relating to this Point, runs thus:——<i>That the</i> Mantle, <i>tempore
Installationis Procuratoris</i>, shall be laid on his Arm,
<i>&amp;c.</i> but whether this shall be construed to that instant of
time, when the <i>Proctor</i> is brought to the <i>Stall</i> of his <i>Principal</i>,
or to some greater Latitude, as during the time of
Installation, including the very first Action, or beginning
of the Ceremony, namely, the being called to the <i>Chapter-House</i>
<span class='pageno' title='398' id='Page_398'></span>Door, and entrance into it, is the Question; because
there are Instances in both, but the latter is most
warrantable by the <i>Statutes</i> and general Practice.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Article in <i>Henry</i> VIIIth’s <i>Statutes</i> being much more
clear in describing and explaining the Ceremonies of <i>Installation</i>,
than any of the former; (the particulars of
which in every Point seems to be excellently regulated,)
having mentioned the Sovereign, or his <i>Deputies</i>, laying
the <i>Mantle</i> on the <i>Proxies</i> Arm, it immediately follows,
as the very next thing to be performed in course of time;
<i>That afterwards he shall be led by two Knights, from the</i>
Chapter-House <i>Door to the</i> Stall, <i>and there being, shall
make his Oath, and be installed</i>; it gives no Account of
laying the <i>Mantle</i> on the Arm of the <i>Proctor</i> at the instant
of <i>Installation</i> in the <i>Choir</i>, that being directed to
be done before. It is also recorded in the <i>Black-Book</i>,
where this Ceremony is more fully treated; <i>That</i> Garter
<i>shall take the</i> Mantle <i>upon his Arms, and deliver it to
both the</i> Knights-Commissioners, <i>and that they</i> (according to
the Tenour of the Statutes,) <i>shall lay it on the</i> Proctor’s
<i>right Shoulder, in the Porch of the</i> Chapter-House.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides, the ancient usage of receiving the <i>Mantle</i> in
the <i>Chapter-House</i>, or at the <i>Chapter-House</i> Door, either
before, or in the Proceeding to the <i>Choir</i>, of which many
instances may be given, there are several modern instances
where the <i>Mantle</i> was born to the <i>Choir</i>, (and sometimes
the <i>Collar</i> of the <i>Order</i> with it,) not by the <i>Proctor</i>, but by
<i>Garter</i>, before him, and delivered in his <i>Principal’s Stall</i>;
as in the Proceeding of the <i>Proxy</i> for the Duke of <i>Wirtembergh</i>,
<i>Anno</i> 2 <i>Jac.</i> I. when, after he had taken the
Oath, and was led into the Duke’s <i>Stall</i>, (not before) was
the Robe laid on his Arm; and so was it done in many
more <i>Installations</i>; which manner hath so far prevail’d as
to be the continu’d Practice, <i>Garter</i> carrying the <i>Mantle</i>
on a Cushion before the <i>Proctors</i> into the <i>Choir</i>, and laying
it (after they have taken their Oaths,) on their Arms in
such manner, that the <i>Cross</i> of St. <i>George</i> may be conspicuous.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Of the Proceeding to the Choir.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 10. Concerning the <i>Proxies</i> Proceeding into the <i>Choir</i>,
King <i>Henry</i> VIIIth’s <i>Statutes</i> direct: <i>That he shall be accompanied
<span class='pageno' title='399' id='Page_399'></span>and led by</i> two Knights-Companions <i>of the</i> Order,
<i>from the Door of the</i> Chapter-House, <i>to the</i> Stall <i>assigned to
his Principal</i>; agreeable to which, is that Passage in the
<i>Black-Book</i>; <i>That as soon as the two Knights have placed
the Mantle on his Arm, they shall take him between them,
and conduct him to the</i> Stall <i>of his Lord</i>; and thus assisted
have all <i>Proxies</i> proceeded to the <i>Choir</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Since the Custom of receiving the <i>Collar</i> in the <i>Chapter-House</i>
was laid aside, the Sovereign, (or his Lieutenant,)
with the <i>Knights-Companions</i>, (so soon as the <i>Mantle</i> is delivered
the <i>Proctor</i>, or (as of late) that he hath been admitted
according to the purport of his Deputation,) proceed
to the <i>Choir</i>, leaving the <i>Proxy</i> behind them in the
<i>Chapter-House</i>, and after they have taken their <i>Stalls</i>, the
Sovereign directs two of the <i>Knights-Companions</i> to descend;
who taking the <i>Alms-Knights</i>, <i>Officers of Arms</i>,
and the three inferior Officers of the <i>Order</i> before them,
pass to the <i>Chapter-House</i>, and bring thence the <i>Proxy</i> to
his <i>Installation</i>. In this Proceeding the <i>Proxy</i> goes Bare-headed,
as did the Earl of <i>Dover</i>, <i>Proctor</i> to <i>Charles</i>, Prince
Palatine of the <i>Rhine</i>, and Sir <i>George Cartaret</i>, <i>Proctor</i> to
the Prince of <i>Denmark</i>, <i>Anno</i> 15 <i>Car.</i> II.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>The Ceremonies of Installation.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 11. When the Proceeding hath entred the <i>Choir</i>, and
paid the accustomed Reverences, both towards the <i>Altar</i>
and the Sovereign’s <i>Stall</i>, and the <i>Alms-Knights</i>, <i>Officers
of Arms</i> and of the <i>Order</i>, taken their usual Stations; the
two Commissioners (<i>Knights-Assistants</i> or <i>Knights-Companions</i>,)
and <i>Proctor</i> make their Reverences together, and
then they conduct him into the lower <i>Stalls</i> directly before
the <i>Stall</i> appointed for his <i>Principal</i>, the foresaid <i>Officers</i>
of the <i>Order</i> standing below in the <i>Choir</i>: If there be
more than two Commissioners, then the two Senior conduct
him as before, while the rest of the Commissioners
take their Station below in the <i>Choir</i>, before their proper
<i>Stalls</i>, and there stay till the <i>Installation</i> be finish’d,
and the like do the <i>Lieutenants-Assistants</i>, except the two
Senior that are imployed in the Ceremony.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>Proxy</i> thus introduced into the lower <i>Stalls</i>, stands
there while the <i>Register</i> pronounceth the Oath of the
<span class='pageno' title='400' id='Page_400'></span><i>Order</i> to him, which he repeats distinctly, laying his
Hand on the <i>New Testament</i>, and afterwards kisseth the
Book.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ancient Oath appointed by the <i>Statutes</i> of Institution
is short, and without limitation in all Points, the same
with that a <i>Knight-Companion</i> takes at his Personal <i>Installation</i>,
<i>viz.</i> <i>Faithfully to observe, to the utmost of his Power,
the</i> Statutes <i>of the</i> Order; but afterwards the Sovereign’s
and Fellows of those other <i>Orders</i> of <i>Knighthood</i>, (as the
<i>Golden Fleece</i>, <i>Monsieur St. Michael</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>) before their admission
into the <i>Order</i> of the <i>Garter</i>, sued for, and obtained
the allowance of some relative exceptions or proviso’s to
be added to the aforesaid Oath; which usually were
such as stood with the interest of their Religion, their
great State or Dignity, or precedent obligation to the
<i>Order</i> they had before accepted.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the <i>Black-Book</i> is a Precedent of the Oath to be taken
by an Emperor; whereby he is obliged to promise on his
Royal Word, and give his Faith on his Honour and the
Holy Evangelists, <i>That he will faithfully and truly, to the
utmost of his Power, observe the Statutes in every Branch
and Article thereof, at least so far as they can or ought to
be observed by him, and so far as they shall not be contrary
or derogatory to those whereunto he hath before given
his Name and Sworn, and saving all other conditions agreed
on</i>. There are besides this, other Precedents in the Annals
of the Form of the Oath from the <i>Proctor</i> of an Emperor
or King, and of every other inferior Degree, wherein
are several exceptions before agreed on; and when
<i>Philip</i>, King of <i>Castile</i> and <i>Leon</i>, (Sovereign of the <i>Order</i>
of the <i>Golden Fleece</i>,) was Personally installed at <i>Windsor</i>,
<i>Anno</i> 22 <i>Hen.</i> VII. and took the Oath without Limitation,
yet he soon after obtain’d the Sovereign’s Dispensation,
that the use of the <i>Collar</i> and other <i>Ensigns</i> of the
<i>Order</i> might be left to his pleasure, and that he might not
be obliged to be present at future <i>Chapters</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Other Exceptions have been admitted, but were obtained
with great difficulty and much debate, lest the Dignity
and Reputation of the <i>Order</i> should (instead of being
kept up) be lessen’d, the forbearance of some Circumstances
that hath been yeilded to, having sometimes been
brought into Precedent, to the prejudice of the <i>Order</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='401' id='Page_401'></span>The exceptions that were allow’d the Arch-Duke of
<i>Austria</i>, when he took the Oath at his Investiture at <i>Noremberg</i>,
<i>Anno</i> 15 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. were as follow.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Not to wear the</i> Garter <i>and</i> Collar <i>but at some certain
times in the Year, at his own pleasure.</i></p>

<p class='c000'><i>That if he were not in Place convenient to go to hear
Mass on St.</i> George’<i>s Day, he should cause a Priest to say it
in his presence.</i></p>

<p class='c000'><i>Not to be obliged, if busied in weighty Affairs, to wear the</i>
Garter, Collar, <i>or whole</i> Habit <i>of the</i> Order, <i>on St.</i> George’<i>s
Day, longer than during divine Service; nevertheless he promised,
if he could not than wear it for a whole Day together,
he would willingly wear it on some other solemn Day
within the compass of the Year.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>Of another nature were the exceptions which <i>Francis</i> I.
King of <i>France</i>, procured to be admitted into the Oath
taken by his <i>Proctor</i>, <i>Anno</i> 19 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. <i>viz.</i> <i>To observe
the Statutes of the</i> Order <i>of the</i> Garter <i>so far as they
were consistent with, and not contrary or prejudicial to the
Statutes of the</i> Order <i>of St.</i> Michael, <i>and other</i> Orders
<i>which his Principal had before taken of other Princes.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>Such like exceptions have been generally allowed to
Kings and Sovereign Princes; but as to the <i>Proxies</i> of
such Strangers, not Sovereign Princes, but Subjects, the
Form of their Oath is usually framed (by the indulgence
of the Sovereign,) with just limitations, not only to their
obligation of the Statutes of any other <i>Order</i> they had accepted,
or any Oath formerly taken, but sometimes to the
Fidelity and Allegiance which they owe their Sovereign
Lord and Prince.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the Oath hath been administred to a Stranger’s
<i>Proxy</i>, (with such or the like exceptions before set down,)
the two <i>Knights-Commissioners</i> pass up with him into the
higher Row of <i>Stalls</i>, and so to that assign’d to his Principal,
where being arrived, they take the <i>Mantle</i> from
<i>Garter</i>, and lay it upon the <i>Proctor’s</i> left Arm, with the
Escutcheon of St. <i>George</i> uppermost, according to an <i>Order</i>
in a <i>Chapter</i> held, <i>Anno</i> 23 <i>Car.</i> II. which was to be
a standing Rule for the future, and is now observ’d.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Act and Ceremony of <i>Installation</i>, the <i>Commissioners</i>
who first conducted the <i>Proxy</i> into the <i>Choir</i>, jointly
embrace him; then the <i>Proxy</i> makes his double Reverence,
and lastly the <i>Commissioners</i>, according to the Custom of
<span class='pageno' title='402' id='Page_402'></span><i>Installations</i>, set him down in his Principal’s <i>Stall</i>, where
he hath used to remain during Divine Service; but by
the aforesaid <i>Order</i> in <i>Chapter</i>, <i>Anno</i> 23 <i>Car.</i> II. the <i>Proxies</i>
are prohibited sitting in their <i>Stalls</i>, but directed to stand
before them uncovered, with their <i>Mantles</i> on their right
Arms, until Divine Service be ended.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two <i>Knights</i> (between whom the <i>Proxy</i> proceeded
to <i>Installation</i>,) descend into the <i>Choir</i>, and stand before
their own <i>Stalls</i>, and after a while, first the Senior <i>Commissioners</i>,
and then the other, ascend into them with
usual Reverences, and then Divine Service begins.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>The Proctor’s Offering.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 12. The <i>Proctor</i> having receiv’d Possession of his
Principal’s <i>Stall</i>, stays in the <i>Choir</i>, and performs the following
Ceremonies, the chief of which is the <i>Offering</i>
of <i>Gold</i> and <i>Silver</i>, according to the Degree and Seniority
of his Principal’s <i>Stall</i>, in case the <i>Installation</i> be in the
Morning; but if it be celebrated when St. <i>George</i>’s Feast is
held by the Sovereign’s <i>Lieutenant</i>, the <i>Proxy</i> ought not to
Offer till the <i>Lieutenant</i> hath first Offered for the Sovereign;
and the <i>Lieutenant</i> also Offereth for himself before
the <i>Proctor</i>, if his Stall be higher than the Stranger’s, for
whom the <i>Proctor</i> is installed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>Proctor</i> in Offering doth it with all the Ceremony
as if his Lord were present; when the <i>Knights-Companions</i>
descend from their Stalls, (which Ceremony begins
with the Junior <i>Knight</i>,) he also descends in his turn, and
placeth himself below in the <i>Choir</i> before the Stall of his
<i>Principal</i>, and if he have an opposite <i>Knight-Companion</i>,
he joins himself to him, and proceeds towards the <i>Altar</i>
to the Offering, with the Officers of Arms before him;
but if no <i>Knight-Companion</i> be opposite, he then proceeds
alone, having his Train born, and a <i>Knight-Companion</i>,
or some other great Personage, suitable to his Degree, attending
on his left Hand, to give him the Offering, which
he Offers kneeling on a Cushion, and after him the rest
of the <i>Knights-Companions</i> present Offer, every one according
to the Seniority of their Stalls.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the Offering, the <i>Proctor</i> taking his way by the
East-end of the Stalls, returns back to the Stall of his <i>Principal</i>,
<span class='pageno' title='403' id='Page_403'></span>and Divine Service being finish’d, and like Honour
in all respects shewed to his <i>Proxy</i> as if his Principal had
been present, he ought to remain in his Master’s Stall
till his next Junior <i>Knight</i> hath left his Stall, and then
descend after him, and stand below before his Stall, till
his turn come to join himself again to the Proceeding, and
so to pass out of the <i>Choir</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sometimes the <i>Proctor</i> hath been receiv’d at his coming
down from his Lord’s Stall by the two <i>Knights-Commissioners</i>
who installed him, as were the <i>Proctors</i> of <i>Frederick</i>
II. King of <i>Denmark</i>, and <i>John</i>, Count Palatine of
the <i>Rhine</i>, between whom they also proceeded to the
<i>Chapter-House</i> Door, in the same manner they were conducted
into the <i>Choir</i>; but notwithstanding this, the <i>Proctor</i>
ought rather to take in his return the Place of his
Principal, (as he did at the Offering, and which is indeed
his right,) and so the <i>Proctor</i> of <i>Francis</i> I. went behind
alone in his Principal’s place, and followed the <i>Knights-Commissioners</i>
from the <i>Choir</i> to the place where he lodged;
and this Method is since followed.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>The Dinner.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 13. When the <i>Installation</i> hath past in the Morning,
there hath usually been prepared a great Dinner at the Sovereign’s
Charge; we need here only mention what is different
in this particular from the Personal <i>Installation</i> of a
<i>Knight-Companion</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>Proxy</i> washes alone, sits at the chief Place of the
Table alone, and is serv’d alone, but the other <i>Knights-Companions</i>
sit at the end of the Table; but if the Sovereign’s
Lieutenant be present, the <i>Proctor</i> dines at the same
Table with him, and then a little before the second Course
is brought in, the Sovereign’s Stile is proclaimed with the
usual Ceremony, in <i>Latin</i>, <i>French</i>, and <i>English</i>; but otherwise
only the Stile of the new installed Prince, and but
once. The Stile and Titles of <i>Christian</i> IV. King of
<i>Denmark</i>, were proclaimed in <i>Latin</i>; and of <i>Maurice</i>,
Prince of <i>Orange</i>, in <i>French</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dinner being ended, all rise in Order and Wash; first, the
<i>Proxy</i> alone, and after him the <i>Knights-Commissioners</i>; and
accompanying the <i>Proctor</i> to his Chamber, where leaving
<span class='pageno' title='404' id='Page_404'></span>him, they retire to their own Lodgings, and there put off
their Habits.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Solemnity of <i>Installation</i> is over, the <i>Proctor</i>
is to take care, that <i>Garter</i> forthwith set up the Atchievements
of his <i>Principal</i> over his <i>Stall</i>, and fix the Plate of
his Arms on the back thereof; in Memorial of the Ceremony
of Inauguration; to which end also Medals have
frequently been struck, to perpetuate the Honour so received.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Fees payable for Strangers.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 4. That Strangers should be liable to the demand
of Fees, was thought unreasonable; therefore by the <i>Statutes</i>
of <i>Institution</i>, the Sovereign is obliged to pay them;
the first Example whereof that we meet with, is an Order,
1 <i>Hen.</i> VI. which appointed: <i>That the usual Fees, due for
the</i> Installation <i>of the King of</i> Denmark, <i>should be discharg’d
by the Sovereign, as the</i> Statute <i>enjoin’d</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>To this purpose Privy-Seals were issued to the Lord
Treasurer for the time being, to pay the Fees to the <i>Register</i>
of the <i>Order</i> out of the <i>Exchequer</i>, which was the
constant Custom, till King <i>Charles</i> I. in the 13th Year of
his Reign, settled an Annual Pension of 1200 <i>l.</i> upon
the <i>Order</i>; and by a Commission in the said Year, impower’d
the Chancellor of the <i>Order</i>, and his Successors,
to pay out of the same, not only the ordinary, but also extraordinary
Charges of the <i>Order</i>; wherein the Fees for
<i>Installation</i> of Strangers are included.</p>

<p class='c000'>Notwithstanding the Sovereign (as we have shown) discharg’d
the <i>Installation</i> Fees due from Strangers, yet they
<span class='pageno' title='410' id='Page_410'></span>or their <i>Proctors</i> for them, did always bestow particular
Rewards on the <i>College</i>, the Officers of the <i>Order</i> and of
<i>Arms</i>, the <i>Alms-Knights</i>, and some others who attended
the Solemnity, and in particular <i>Garter</i> had anciently bestowed
on him a rich Gown, to wear at the time of <i>Installation</i>,
but of late he has been presented with some
other thing of considerable Value. They also were liberal
to the Officers of <i>Arms</i>, as appears by several <i>Largesses</i>
given to them by their <i>Proctors</i>, and in general to the
greatest part of those that gave their Attendance.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch18' class='c005'>CAP. XVIII.<br /> <br /><i>Of the Grand Feast of the</i> Order.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'><i>The Grand Feast appointed to be celebrated Annually on <br />St.</i> George’<i>s</i> Day.</h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 1.</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c009'>By
the <i>Statutes</i> of <i>Institution</i>, it’s ordain’d, That
a solemn Festival should be Annually celebrated
on the 23d Day of <i>April</i>, or St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Day</i>,
in Honour of the Patron of the <i>Order</i>, as is observed in
other military Orders, erected since this of the <i>Garter</i>,
to which this seems to give Rules of holding their Festivals
on the Anniversary of their Patrons. Thus <i>Philip</i>,
Duke of <i>Burgundy</i>, on his erecting the <i>Order</i> of the <i>Golden
Fleece</i>, taking St. <i>Andrew</i> for its Patron, appointed the
Festival on St. <i>Andrew</i>’s <i>Day</i>. <i>Lewis</i> XI. King of <i>France</i>,
appointed <i>Michaelmas Day</i> for holding the Feast of the
<i>Order</i> of St. <i>Michael</i>. And so the Festival of the Duke of
<i>Savoy</i>’s <i>Order</i> of the <i>Annunciade</i>, on <i>Lady Day</i>. The Duke
of <i>Bourbon</i>’s <i>Order</i> of the Knights of our <i>Lady</i>, on the
Conception of our <i>Lady</i> (8th <i>December</i>;) and other instances
might likewise be given if it were necessary.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>The Anniversary of St.</i> George <i>fixed by the Church,<br /> to the twenty third of</i> April.</h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 2. That the 23d of <i>April</i> was the Day whereon St.
<span class='pageno' title='411' id='Page_411'></span><i>George</i> suffered Martyrdom by Beheading, appears from
the <i>Greek Hexamiter</i> before his Commemoration; which
was the Day observed both by the <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin
Church</i>; as also by our Predecessors, the <i>Saxons</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>St.</i> George’<i>s</i> Day <i>made</i> Festum duplex.</h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 3. After the Sovereign and <i>Knights-Companions</i> had
encreased the Honour of their Patron’s Festival, our
Church began to take greater notice of it, being now
also esteemed among us as the Patron of the Nation;
and therefore they bestowed an addition of Honour upon
it, by making it <i>Festum duplex, ad Modum Majorum Duplicis</i>.
3 <i>Hen.</i> V.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>The Place for celebrating the Grand Feast, assigned to</i> Windsor-Castle.</h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 4. The Founder of this most Noble <i>Order</i> having
fixed on this Day, for performing its Solemnities, he
made Choice of that of his Nativity, the <i>Castle</i> of <i>Windsor</i>,
which for a long time after was inviolably observed
there, either upon the very Day, or some other appointed
by Prorogation, not long after: For which way of Prorogation,
allowance was given by the <i>Statutes</i> of the <i>Order</i>,
and of which the <i>Registers</i> are full of instances.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>St.</i> George’<i>s</i> Day <i>kept apart from the Grand Feast,<br /> and how then observed</i>.</h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 5. How this Noble <i>Order</i> flourished from its Foundation
to the time of <i>Henry</i> V. no Account can be given,
since the Annals thereof are wanting to his Reign; but
then it appears to have been in considerable Splendor; but
the Civil Wars toward the end of <i>Henry</i> VIth’s Reign,
eclipsed it for a while. Under King <i>Edward</i> IV. when
things were a little settled, it seem’d to recover; and in
King <i>Henry</i> VIIIth’s time, was at a greater heighth than
ever. However, though the several Branches of the <i>Order</i>
receiv’d some Augmentation from the influence of this
<span class='pageno' title='412' id='Page_412'></span>Monarch, yet the Grand Feast began to decline, by a removal
of the observation of St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Day</i> from <i>Windsor</i>,
and a prorogatory Celebration of the Grand Feast to
other times.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Article of the <i>Statutes</i>, causing this great alteration
from the original design of the first Institution, gives the
Sovereign Power to prorogue the Grand Feast at his Pleasure;
but then ’tis evident from the same Statute, that St.
<i>George</i>’s <i>Day</i> was nevertheless ordained to be duly observed
by it self, in what Place soever the Sovereign (if within
the Realm) should then reside; <i>Windsor</i> hereby being
not excluded.</p>

<p class='c000'>It farther implies, the sacred <i>Rites</i> and <i>Offices</i> to be performed,
with other Matters concerning the <i>Order</i>; for besides
the particulars therein enumerated, this general
Clause is observable: That what other urgent Affair soever,
relating to the <i>Order</i>, should offer it self to be performed,
the same might be treated of, and receive dispatches,
in the <i>Chapter</i> held where the Sovereign then
should be, as fully as if he were at <i>Windsor Castle</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>So that henceforward, all things began to be ordered,
both on the Eve the Day of St. <i>George</i>, and the Morrow
after, with as great State; all Affairs as legally dispatched,
and all Ceremonies as magnificently performed, except
that of offering up of Atchievements, which is peculiar
to the Chappel of St. <i>George</i> at <i>Windsor</i> only, as could
be observed at the <i>Grand Festival</i> it self.</p>

<p class='c000'>And how, by Virtue of this Article, and with what
Ceremonies St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Day</i> was held, when the Grand
Feast was prorogued, is evident from a full and ample Precedent,
22 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. now remaining in the <i>Office</i> of <i>Arms</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>For though the Sovereign with 13 <i>Knights-Companions</i>
were at <i>Windsor</i> that Year, upon the 22, 23 and 24 of
<i>April</i>, yet at that time they observed only the Feast Day of
St. <i>George</i>, with the Eve and Morrow after, but deferred,
by Order in <i>Chapter</i>, the Celebration of the Grand
Feast, to the 8th of <i>May</i> ensuing.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>The Grand Feast neglected by King</i> Edward <i>VI.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 6. From the Accession of this Prince, the Sovereignty
of this <i>Order</i> became more neglected, so that during his
<span class='pageno' title='413' id='Page_413'></span>Reign, no Anniversary of St. <i>George</i> was kept at <i>Windsor</i>,
by a <i>Grand Festival</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is supposed to be owing to the common Calamity
of that Age, wherein most Ceremonies, solemn or splendid,
especially such as related to Divine Services, came
under the denomination of being either Superstitious or
Idolatrous. Insomuch, that at a <i>Chapter</i> held at <i>Greenwich</i>,
2 <i>Edw.</i> VI. an Abolition being intended for such
Ceremonies as were not consonant to the King’s Injunctions,
lately prescribed, it was then decreed, that then,
and for ever from thenceforth, at the Feast of this most
Noble <i>Order</i>, no other Ceremonies should be observed
than such as were appointed by his Majesties Letter.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>That no Procession should be made with going about the
Church, or Church-yard, but the King’s Majesty’s Procession,
lately set forth in</i> English <i>to be used. His Majesty and other</i>
Knights-Companions <i>sitting in their Stalls, at the Entry,
such Reverences to be made to the King’s Majesty only as was
heretofore. The Offering to be in the Box for the Poor, without
any other Reverence, or kissing any Paten, or other thing;
but only at the return, due Reverence to the King, as was used
before. The Mass of</i> Requiem <i>to be left undone, but yet,
both on St.</i> George’<i>s</i> Day, <i>and for next Day, a Mass to be
Sung with great Reverence; in which, immediately after the
Words of Consecration is said, the Priest shall say the</i> Pater
Noster, <i>and so turn and Communicate to all, or so many of the</i>
Order, <i>or other, after they have done, as shall be disposed to
receive the Communion, according to the</i> Order <i>prescribed by
his Majesty’s Book of Communion, and without any other
Rite or Ceremony after the said Communion to be used; except
some godly Psalm or Hymn to be Sung in</i> English, <i>and
so to end the said Service. All</i> Chapters, <i>and other Rites
concerning the</i> Order, <i>not being contrary to these, to remain
as they have been used.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>This Decree seemed to mean nothing less than a Prohibition
to the holding the Grand Feast at <i>Windsor</i>, at least
the neglect of its Celebration there, whilst King <i>Edw.</i> VI.
lived: And though toward the End of his Reign, some
care was taken for a Permission to hold the said Feast,
either on St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Day</i>, or some other appointed by
Prorogation; yet it was without any regard to the ancient
and usual Place; for when the Act passed, commanding
the Days therein mentioned to be kept Holy, and no other,
<span class='pageno' title='414' id='Page_414'></span>whereby this was involved among many other Saints Days
then prohibited to be kept, as not being found among the
Feasts then Establish’d; it was considered, that a Proviso
and Allowance should be entered in the aforesaid Act, for
the Celebration of this Feast, particularly by the <i>Knights-Companions</i>;
which Act, though it suffered a Repeal by
Queen <i>Mary</i>, yet stands in force at this Day, being revived
by King <i>James</i> I. his repealing that <i>Statute</i> of
1 <i>Mar.</i> <i>Cap.</i> 2.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Removed from</i> Windsor <i>by Queen</i> Elizabeth.</h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 7. But the most fatal Blow given to the growing
Honour of the Castle of <i>Windsor</i>, was a Decree in <i>Chapter</i>
held 9 <i>Eliz.</i> with the consent of the <i>Knights-Companions</i>
then present, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c000'><i>That if on the Vigil and Day of St.</i> George, <i>the Feast
was not held at</i> Windsor, <i>according to the usual Custom, it
should nevertheless be sufficient, if the Observation thereof
were kept at the same Place where the Sovereign should then
happen to be, where also the rest of the</i> Knights-Companions
<i>were obliged to be present, no less than if the Feast had been
held at</i> Windsor.</p>

<p class='c000'>And so severe was the latter part of this Decree against
the flourishing condition of that Place, that it commanded
also,</p>

<p class='c000'><i>That no other Solemnity, under the notion of St.</i> George’<i>s
Feast, should thenceforth be celebrated at</i> Windsor, <i>except
upon occasion of the</i> Installation <i>of some illustrious Person,
and then also, not without express leave of the Sovereign.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>And to say truth, this <i>Statute</i> was but too strictly observed
during her Reign; for we meet but with one Feast
of St. <i>George</i> held there, till 1 <i>Jac.</i> I. (unless we mistake
the Feasts of <i>Installation</i> for those of St. <i>George</i>,) but
then the Sovereign, who was yet in <i>Scotland</i>, lent his
Commission, dated 5 <i>April</i>, to the Earl of <i>Nottingham</i>, his
<i>Lieutenant</i>, to prorogue the Festival to the 3d <i>July</i> following,
and after constituted him to hold the Feast, which
was performed the 2, 3 and 4 Days of the said Month,
with all Pomp and Ceremony. The King himself, being
then at <i>Windsor</i>, was prevented from being present by
some occasion not mentioned.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='415' id='Page_415'></span>Thus, after a long Interval, the Honour of the Feast
was restored, which had this effect, toward the End of
King <i>James</i> I. Reign, and that of his Son and Successor,
King <i>Charles</i> I. that it begat a Re-union of the Feast and
Place, whereby the Castle of <i>Windsor</i>, famous for the
<i>Institution</i> of this most Noble <i>Order</i>, retrieved its ancient
Honour, of having its Solemnities celebrated there.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Of Prorogation of the Grand Feast.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 8. Having thus noted, that from the beginning of
King <i>Henry</i> VIIIth’s Reign, till of late Years, the Grand
Feast was seldom observed upon the precise Day of
St. <i>George</i>; and that the occasion how both Day and
Feast came to be celebrated apart, took its rise from the
indulgence of the <i>Statutes</i> in point of Prorogation: ’Tis
necessary farther to observe, that this Prorogation is of two
sorts, either Absolute, as being enjoined by the <i>Statutes</i>;
or else Arbitrary, at the Sovereign’s Pleasure, upon intervening
Reasons.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the first of these the Founder’s <i>Statutes</i> enjoin, <i>That
if the Feast of St.</i> George <i>shall happen within fifteen Days
next after</i> Easter Day, <i>it shall be prorogued to the Sunday
Fortnight, or fifteen Days after</i> Easter Day. And the reason
is there given, <i>That every of the</i> Knights-Companions <i>might
have opportunity of coming thereto, without being constrained
to ride upon any of those three Holy Days preceeding</i> Easter
Day. The same Rule for Prorogation, where there is a
concurrence of these two Feasts, is likewise enjoin’d by
the <i>Statutes</i> of King <i>Henry</i> V. and King <i>Henry</i> VIII.</p>

<p class='c000'>And when the Grand Feast, in this case of <i>Easter</i>, has
been kept before the expiration of the said fifteen Days,
the <i>Knights-Companions</i> then absent, to avoid the Penalty
for their not appearing, have made Excuse; that the ancient
<i>Statutes</i> of the <i>Order</i> were violated in keeping the
Feast within fifteen Days after <i>Easter</i>, as was alledged
when Sir <i>John Denham</i>, Lord Treasurer, as President,
held the Feast of St. <i>George</i> at <i>Windsor</i>, 24 <i>April</i>, 8
<i>Henry</i> VII.</p>

<p class='c000'>Anciently, where the <i>Register</i> mentions the Grand Feast
to be held at <i>Windsor</i>, beyond the Day of St. <i>George</i>, ’tis
observable upon Calculation, that <i>Easter Day</i>, in those
<span class='pageno' title='416' id='Page_416'></span>times, fell too near the 23d of <i>April</i>, to celebrate the Feast
on, without breaking the Law, which was the real cause
of those Prorogations, of which there are many Instances.</p>

<p class='c000'>And as the <i>Knights-Companions</i> had Prohibitions put upon
the Solemnization of their Feast, in case of its interfering
with <i>Easter</i>, so had the Church of <i>England</i>, in their Observation
of St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Day</i>, in reference to several other
Festivals; and this continued till the time of the Reformation
begun by King <i>Edward</i> VI. but since the Grand
Feast has been celebrated upon any of them indifferently
the Feast of <i>Easter</i> only excepted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The second sort of Prorogations, which are meerly
Arbitrary, and wholly dependent on the Sovereign’s Pleasure,
yet warranted sufficiently from the Words, <i>Causa
postulante</i>, mentioned in King <i>Henry</i> VIII’s Statutes; as
likewise the great Latitude given the Sovereigns of this
most Noble <i>Order</i>, in reference to their Affairs, in the
same Statutes: The first Precedent of which was, <i>Anno</i>
5 <i>Hen.</i> V. when about <i>August</i>, four Months after St.
<i>George</i>’s <i>Day</i>, that King being engaged in the Wars of
<i>France</i>, ordered the Feast to be celebrated at <i>Caen</i> in <i>Normandy</i>,
and with great Solemnity created fifteen Knights
into the <i>Order</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are several other Examples, particularly one
8 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. when the King being at <i>Eltham</i> on St. <i>George</i>’s
<i>Day</i>, it was in a <i>Chapter</i> there held, Decreed, That the accustomed
Feast of St. <i>George</i> should be observed at <i>Windsor</i>
25th of <i>May</i> ensuing. And from this time it became Annually
customary, to keep the Day of St. <i>George</i> where the
Sovereign at that time made his Abode: On which Day,
and the Day after, the usual Solemnities were observed.
But as to the Solemnization of the Grand Feast itself,
that was in one of the <i>Chapters</i> then held, adjourned to
some farther time, and then solemnized at <i>Windsor</i> by
Prorogation, not by the Sovereigns themselves, but by
their <i>Lieutenants</i> and their <i>Assistants</i> appointed for that
purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>But to proceed with the Causes of Prorogation, which
were either for some weighty reasons, or upon emergent
Occasions; <i>Anno</i> 1 <i>Mariæ</i>, the Sovereign celebrating
the Feast of St. <i>George</i> at St. <i>James</i>’s, <i>Philip</i>, Prince of
<i>Spain</i>, and the Earl of <i>Sussex</i>, were on the Morrow after
elected into the <i>Order</i>; whereupon it was likewise Decreed,
<span class='pageno' title='417' id='Page_417'></span>that the Inauguration of these two <i>elect Knights</i>,
till the Prince came to <i>England</i>, which happening <i>21st
July</i> following, the Grand Feast, together with that of the
<i>elect Knights</i> Installations, were appointed to be celebrated
at the same time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again 3 and 4 <i>Phil.</i> and <i>Mar.</i> at a <i>Chapter</i> held <i>22d
April</i>, the Feast of St. <i>George</i>, together with the Installation
of three <i>elect Knights</i>, was appointed to be held at
<i>Windsor</i> the <i>9th</i> of <i>May</i> ensuing; and by a <i>Chapter</i> summon’d
the <i>3d</i> of <i>May</i>, before the appointed Day for
holding the Feast, the same was prorogued to the <i>15th</i>
of <i>December</i> following, upon the pressing Affairs of the
King and Queen. But before that design’d time came,
another <i>Chapter</i> was held on the <i>31st</i> of <i>October</i>,
wherein it was again prorogu’d to the first Sunday after
<i>Twelfth-day</i>, viz. <i>9 January</i>, if by that time the King,
who was then in <i>Flanders</i>, should return to <i>England</i>: But
that not happening, it was farther prorogu’d to the <i>20th</i>
of <i>February</i>; and thence, by another Decree, to St. <i>George</i>’s
<i>Day</i>. Of which there are many other Examples, and
sometimes upon other Occasions; but still at the Sovereign’s
Pleasure.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Of Commissions of Prorogation.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 9. There is no Precedent of Commissions for Prorogation,
ancienter than 12 <i>Car.</i> I. left by Sir <i>Thomas Rowe</i>,
wherein Notice is taken of all the Adjournments of the
Grand Feasts, from St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Day</i> preceeding, till that
Time, with the Reasons thereof, and chiefly upon Consideration
of the spreading Sickness, together with a Command
to the <i>Knights-Companions</i>, and the Officers of the
<i>Order</i>, to attend the Sovereign on the new assign’d Days
for celebrating the Feast.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the Substance hereof, the succeeding Commissions
very near agree, yet with some little Difference; as
first, the Preambles are general, and run thus: <i>Whereas,
upon special Reasons, and other important Affairs</i>, &amp;c. except
the Commission issu’d <i>25th February</i>, 1637. where
the Preamble was fitted to a special Occasion, and runs
thus,——<i>Whereas we have determined to create the Prince,
our eldest Son, a Knight, and to propose him in Election as a
<span class='pageno' title='418' id='Page_418'></span>Companion of our most Noble</i> Order, <i>for the more Conveniency
of his</i> Installation, <i>We have thought fit to defer the Feast of
St.</i> George, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>But in the Commissions of Prorogation of the Grand
Feast, <i>25th February</i>, 19 <i>Car.</i> I. the Place appointed for
Celebration is omitted, which Defect we find in the above-mentioned
Precedent also; yet afterwards that material
Part came to be inserted, and first of all in that Commission
of the <i>26th February</i>, 14 <i>Car.</i> I. where the Place, being
the City of <i>York</i>, is put into the Body of the Commission.
And when the Civil War drew on, and the Sovereign
could not well ascertain any Place, then the
Grand Feast was appointed to be kept at any such Place
as, on a nearer View, should seem convenient; afterwards
it vary’d something, and came to be inserted thus,—<i>Wheresoever
We shall then be</i>; or thus, <i>at such Places as We shall
timely appoint</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most ordinary course, preparatory to the issuing
such Commissions of Prorogation, has been by the Sovereign’s
Declaration in <i>Chapter</i>, or otherwise the Signification
of his Pleasure to the Chancellor of the <i>Order</i> at any
other Time, who thereupon drew up the Commission,
and presented it to the Sovereign for his Sign Manual,
and then affixed thereto the great Seal of the <i>Order</i>. But
where the Chancellor was not at Hand to receive the Sovereign’s
Commands, in this Case it was convey’d to him
by some other Hand, with command to summon the
<i>Knights-Companions</i> and Officers accordingly. For so it
was done to Sir <i>Francis Windebank</i>, Knt. Secretary of
State, by his Letter to Sir <i>Thomas Rowe</i>, 13 <i>Car.</i> I. for Prorogation
of the Grand Feast.</p>

<p class='c000'>And as all the preceeding Adjournments of the Grand
Feast have been either decreed in <i>Chapter</i>, or directed immediately
from the Sovereign; so there is a Precedent
where the <i>Lieutenant</i> has been impowered to prorogue
the same; yet to the Time and Place appointed by the
Sovereign, and inserted in the Commission of <i>Lieutenancy</i>:
And this was in a Commission, 1 <i>Jac.</i> I. directed to <i>Charles</i>,
Earl of <i>Nottingham</i>.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' title='419' id='Page_419'></span>
<h3 class='c010'><i>That the Grand Feast ought to be celebrated once a Year.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>§ 10. Though the Prorogations of the Grand Feast
have been occasionally made use of on the aforesaid important
Reasons, yet no such Adjournment or Prorogation
is legally to be inlarged beyond St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Day</i> ensuing;
because once within the compass of every Year, the Grand
Feast ought to be solemniz’d; for so it was ordained
by the <i>Statutes</i> at the Institution of the <i>Order</i>, and confirmed
likewise by the succeeding <i>Statutes</i>. And when
our Historians take notice of the Grand Feast, they speak
of the same thing, that it ought Annually to be performed;
whence it is frequently called in the Registers, <i>Annua
Festivitatis</i>, <i>solemnitas annua</i>, <i>celebritas <a id='annua' name='annua'></a>annua</i>, and
the like.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of late Times, an Occasion happen’d that brought this
of the <i>Statutes</i>, into a solemn Debate in <i>Chapter</i>, which,
for the Result thereof, became very remarkable.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>At a</i> Chapter <i>held at</i> White-Hall, <i>2d</i> February, 1640.</h3>

<p class='c011'><i>The Sovereign propos’d to the</i> Knights-Companions, <i>that
having prorogued the Celebration of St.</i> George’<i>s</i> Feast <i>from
time to time, to the</i> 1st, 2d, <i>and</i> 3d <i>of</i> March, <i>so near Lent,
that if the Feast were not held on these Days, it could not
be done within the compass of that Year; because the</i> 23d <i>of</i>
April, <i>for the next Year, did fall on</i> Good-Friday, <i>and so
consequently must have been kept in Lent this Year, or not at
all; and considering the great and important Affairs of the
Parliament, he moved the Question, whether, if there were
no Feast kept this Year, it would be any Blemish to the Honour
of the</i> Order? <i>And whether he might not dispence with
the</i> Statute, <i>and defer it till next Year? They all confessed
the Sovereign’s dispensing Power; yet some of the</i> Knights
<i>seeing from the Institution to that Time, no Precedent
was found where the Grand Feast had been wholly omitted,
but that some of the Sovereigns, even though engaged in War
beyond Sea, either solemniz’d the Feast in their own Presence,
<span class='pageno' title='420' id='Page_420'></span>or by Commission in</i> England, <i>which was averred by
the</i> Chancellor <i>to be both the fundamental and constant Practice,
humbly besought the Sovereign not to begin to make
any Breach in the constant</i> Order, <i>so long and uninterruptedly
continued. Whereupon it was resolv’d, by general Vote,
that the Feast should be celebrated on the aforesaid Days of
Prorogation.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>By which Determination it sufficiently appears, of what
Moment the Sovereign and <i>Knights-Companions</i> then conceiv’d
it to the Honour of the <i>Order</i>, to follow the <i>Statutes</i>,
for the Celebration of the Grand Feast once every
Year. Besides, it is observable, that it was not thought
expedient to be dispens’d with, even on the most pressing
and important Occasions. But rather than the <i>Statutes</i>
should suffer any Violation, the Feast was then solemniz’d,
tho’ they were so straiten’d, in point of time, as not to
have above two Days to make Preparation for it.</p>

<p class='c000'>And though indeed, on the breaking out of the unhappy
Civil War, the Sovereign was oblig’d to defer the Solemnity
from Year to Year, it was not to be look’d on as any
Precedent; and on the Restauration of King <i>Charles</i> II. it
renew’d its former <i>Order</i>.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch19' class='c005'>CAP. XIX.<br /> <br /><i>Of Preparations for the Grand Feast of the</i> Order.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Of Letters giving Notice of the Time and Place.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 1.</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_5_0_7 c009'>Among
many other things which are necessary
to be prepar’d beforehand; the first of Course
is, the Letters directed to all the <i>Knights-Companions</i>
and Officers of the <i>Order</i>, resident within the
Kingdom, to give them Notice of the Time and Place,
when and where the Feast is to be held. (2.) Letters of
Dispensation to such Knights, as the Sovereign shall please
to excuse from their Attendance at the Feast. (3.) Commissions
<span class='pageno' title='421' id='Page_421'></span>of Lieutenancy, (or sometimes of Assistance)
when the Sovereign cannot personally solemnize the same.
(4.) Warrants for the Removal of Atchievements, if there
be then Occasion. (5.) Escutcheons and Stiles, to be set
on the back of each <i>Knight-Companion’s</i> Stall, if the Feast
be held elsewhere than at <i>Windsor</i>. (6.) The Chappel to
be decently adorn’d. (7.) The great Hall, or other
Place, for the Grand Dinner, to be prepar’d, and very
nobly furnish’d. (8.) And lastly, Officers to be appointed,
besides those of the <i>Order</i> of Arms, who are to give peculiar
Attendance on the Sovereign, at this Grand Solemnity.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the first of these Points, the Chancellor is to attend
the Sovereign some convenient Time before the approach
of St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Day</i>, to learn his Pleasure therein,
and whether he is inclined to Prorogue the Day, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>If the Sovereign be inclin’d to a Prorogation, then the
Chancellor is to draw up a Commission for that purpose.
After this, Letters issu’d out anciently under the Sovereign’s
Sign Manual, both to his Lieutenant, when he
holds not the Feast personally, and the <i>Knights-Companions</i>,
giving them notice of the Time and Place; but of late
the Chancellor hath been appointed to dispatch these Letters
in his own Name.</p>

<p class='c000'>But whether the Feast be held upon St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Day</i>,
or any other, by Prorogation, the Sovereign’s Pleasure
was usually known so long before the appointed Time,
that these circular Letters issu’d out sometimes two,
three, four, five, or six Months, before the assign’d Day.
And in Cases where there has been farther Prorogations,
Care has been taken to issue out new Commissions, in the
like convenient Time, before the old were expir’d; as
may be observ’d by what has gone before; that so those
<i>Knights Companions</i>, who are most remote from Court,
may have sufficient Time to prepare; either for Attendance,
or, on just Occasion, to apply themselves to the Sovereign,
for Letters of Dispensation for Absence: And farther, that
the absent Knights may thereby take notice of the Day
set, because such are oblig’d to hold the Feast in their
own Houses, at the same Time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides the Letters directed to the <i>Knights-Companions</i>;
the Chancellor is likewise to write his Letters to each of
the Officers of the <i>Order</i>, to give them the like notice.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' title='422' id='Page_422'></span>
<h3 class='c010'><i>Of Dispensations for not attending the Grand Feast.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>§ 2. It having been complained of by the Chancellor
of the <i>Order</i>, and taken notice of by the Sovereign and
<i>Knights-Companions</i>, in a Chapter held at the Celebration
of the Grand Feast, 13 <i>Car.</i> I. at <i>White-Hall</i>:</p>

<p class='c000'><i>That of late Years, divers</i> Knights-Companions <i>had neglected,
both their Attendance on the Sovereign at the Feast
of St.</i> George, <i>or to send, under their Seals of Arms, their
probable Excuses, and Petitions for Licence and Dispensation,
contrary to the most ancient</i> Statutes, <i>and their Duty.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>It was therefore, among many other things, decreed,
<i>That for the future, every Knight of the</i> Order <i>should be
bound to attend on the usual Days, or such as should be assigned
by Prorogation</i>: But in Case of Sickness, or other
important Business to retard them, they shou’d, under
their Seals of Arms to the Chancellor, signify the Reasons
for requiring a Dispensation for their Absence, twenty
Days at least before the usual, or assigned Time, to
be presented by him to the Sovereign; and on Neglect of
so doing, except in sudden Accidents, should not be excused,
but incur the Penalty of the <i>Statutes</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>And it is evident, that this way of enjoining the <i>Knights-Companions</i>
to send the Reason that prevented their Attendance,
under their Seals, has been very ancient; for the
<i>Black-Book</i> records an <i>Order</i> in <i>Chapter</i>, held at a General
Feast, 1 <i>Hen.</i> VI. to this very Purpose; and enjoin’d farther,
<i>That when such absent Knights were present at the
next Feast, they should be oblig’d to give the Reason why they
should not incur the Penalty of their former Absence, since the</i>
Statutes <i>enjoin it</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Pursuance of the beforementioned Decree, Sir <i>Thomas
Rowe</i>, then Chancellor, added to those his Letters,
dated 18 <i>May</i>, 1637, and directed to the <i>Knights-Companions</i>,
under the Seal of the <i>Order</i>, this following Postscript.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>According to two Acts made in</i> Chapter, <i>in the Presence
of the Sovereign</i>, 18 April, 1637. <i>concerning the Neglect of
the</i> Knights-Companions, <i>in their Attendance upon his Majesty
at the Feast of St.</i> George, <i>and a Command expresly receiv’d
to signify so much to your</i> Lordship; <i>I have the true
<span class='pageno' title='423' id='Page_423'></span>Copies of the Acts themselves, it being resolv’d, in Case of
Omission of your lawful and timely Excuse, under your Seal
of Arms, and in Occasion of Absence, in keeping the Solemnity
in your own House, that no Dispensation shall be given,
but your</i> Lordship <i>shall incur the Penalties of the ancient</i>
Statutes; <i>which are, That you shall not be permitted to the</i>
Chapter, <i>nor to your Seat, the next Year; but shall stand
before it, as do the</i> Choiristers: <i>In Procession then you shall
go before, and not in your Place among the Knights, and
shall Offer last; and that this Penance being done, you
shall come before the Seat of the Sovereign, and ask Absolution:
But if two Years successively your</i> Lordship <i>shall omit
your Attendance, or timely Suit for Dispensation, you shall
pay twenty Marks, and that Sum to be doubled for every
Year of such Omission, till you are reconcil’d, and pardon’d
by the Sovereign, whereof I beseech your</i> Lordship <i>to take
Knowledge.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>It afterwards appears, by an <i>Order</i> past in <i>Chapter</i>,
<i>9th October</i>, 15 <i>Car.</i> I. that this early Notice to be given
from such of the <i>Knights-Companions</i> as, upon the Reasons
already mention’d, should be absent, was design’d chiefly
in Favour of the Officers of the Sovereign’s <i>Houshold</i>,
who, by knowing in due Time who should be absent,
and who not, might make timely and certain Provision
for the Feast.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon Notice sent by the Chancellor, to the <i>Knights-Companions</i>,
as aforesaid, if any of them should happen to
be any way indispos’d, or have other lawful Excuse for
not repairing to Court, and attending the Feast, they may
acquaint the Chancellor therewith, whose Duty it is to
represent it to the Sovereign, and thereon to procure his
Letters of Dispensation for their Absence, if the Sovereign
consents.</p>

<p class='c000'>Which Letters are to be convey’d by <i>Garter</i>, or carry’d
by whomsoever he shall appoint; for which there was a
Fee by the Mile allowed him, by the following <i>Order</i>,
past at a Meeting held by the <i>Knights-Commissioners</i>, for
regulating Points relating to the <i>Order</i>, 13 <i>Car.</i> I.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Whereas it having anciently been the Office of</i> Garter,
King <i>of</i> Arms, <i>to disperse and send Letters of Prorogation,
Dispensation, and other Commands of the Sovereign, to the
absent Knights, which in many Cases must be chargeable, it
was this Day order’d, That if he should send any Act of
<span class='pageno' title='424' id='Page_424'></span>Favour or Dispensation to any Knight, absent from his Majesty’s
Court, or four Miles from the City of</i> London, <i>he to
whom such Dispensation should be sent, should pay his Servant
or Messenger, for every Day’s Travel, as much as is allow’d
and paid any other Messengers of his Majesty’s House
or Chamber.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>Variety of Occasions and Accidents, as Grounds to move
the Sovereign, and Inducements to obtain his Dispensation,
are extant in several Letters sent to Sir <i>Thomas Rowe</i>,
when Chancellor, on the aforesaid Injunctions, decreed
13 <i>Car.</i> I. but they all agree in the Causes we have mentioned.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Of Commissions of Lieutenancy.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 3. Touching the third particular, and preparing Commissions
of Lieutenancy, in such Cases where the Sovereign
cannot personally celebrate the Feast; as also Commissions
for those whom he thinks fit to appoint for his
<i>Assistants</i>, the Reader is referr’d to the Head in the next
<i>Chapter</i>, under which there is an Account of constituting a
<i>Lieutenant</i>; and here only observe, that the Chancellor is
to draw up these Commissions, and attend the Sovereign
for his Hand, and after to pass them under the Great Seal
of the <i>Order</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Warrant for the Removal of Atchievements.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 4. If there be Occasion for Removal of any of the
<i>Knights-Companions</i> Atchievements, at the Grand Feast,
which indeed has seldom happen’d, unless an Installation
were celebrated at the same time, then does the Chancellor
obtain the Sovereign’s Warrant, directed to <i>Garter</i>,
for the Performance thereof: But of this we have already
said sufficient, under the Head of Preparations made for
Personal Installations of a <i>Knight-Companion</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Escutcheons of Arms and Stiles.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 5. Heretofore, when the Celebrations of St. <i>George</i>’s
<i>Day</i> were kept at any other Place besides <i>Windsor Castle</i>,
<span class='pageno' title='425' id='Page_425'></span>it was thought most necessary to provide large Paper Escutcheons;
wherein were Marshalled the Arms and Quarterings
of the Sovereign, and each <i>Knight-Companion</i>, in
Metal and Colour, encompass’d with a <i>Garter</i>; and thereon
Crowns, Caps, or Coronets, peculiar to each Dignity,
with their Stiles and Titles fairly printed underneath,
(but without Crests or Supporters,) to be set on the Back-side
of their Stalls, on the Eve of the Feast: But the Sovereign’s
Arms were impaled with those of St. <i>George</i>, over
which an imperial Crown was plac’d, and these, (in Defect
of the Plates and Banners, set over their Stalls, in the
Choir of St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Chappel</i> at <i>Windsor</i>,) did serve for
Directions for the <i>Knights-Companions</i>, that, by the view of
them, they might the more readily and certainly know
their proper Stalls.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have not met with any Memorial of this Usage,
that reacheth higher than <i>Anno</i> 21 <i>Hen.</i> VII. when the
Sovereign, holding the Day of St. <i>George</i> at <i>Cambridge</i>,
<i>King’s College Chappel</i> was furnish’d with Escutcheons of
the <i>Knights-Companions</i> Arms; but to shew the Use was
ancient, there is this Note put into the Memorial, [as was
Yearly accustomed,] <i>Anno</i> 22 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. the Sovereign
being at <i>Windsor</i> on the Eve of St. <i>George</i>, appointed the
Service of the Church to be celebrated in his Chappel,
in the upper Quadrangle of <i>Windsor Castle</i>; and there
being present with him thirteen <i>Knights-Companions</i>, each
of them had set over their Heads an Escutcheon of their
Arms.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Manner the Stalls were afterwards solemnly establish’d,
and enlarged to absent Knights, by an <i>Order</i> of
<i>Chapter</i>, held at <i>Greenwich</i>, <i>Anno</i> 3 <i>Edward</i> VI. wherein
the Sovereign and <i>Knights-Companions</i> agreed, that from
thenceforth every Stall, upon St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Eve</i>, should have
an Escutcheon of the Arms of them which are absent, as
well as those that were present, at their several Costs and
Charges:</p>

<p class='c000'>But this cannot be understood of the Stalls situate in
the Chappel of St. <i>George</i> at <i>Windsor</i>; for besides, that
we have met with no ancient Account of any such Custom
in that Place, we find a Memorial, rather implying the
contrary; when Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>, in the sixth Year of her
Reign, held the Feast of St. <i>George</i> upon its proper Day,
at <i>Windsor Castle</i>; namely, that there was no Escutcheons
<span class='pageno' title='426' id='Page_426'></span>of the <i>Knights-Companions</i> Arms set up there, but
only the Plates; and without all doubt, had it been the
Usage to fix Escutcheons in the Choir of that Chappel, as
at other Places, they would not at that time especially
have been omitted; because then the Sovereign appear’d
upon an extraordinary Occasion, and where many things
were added to heighten the Glory of that Grand Feast,
by Reason the Peace between <i>England</i> and <i>France</i> was to
be proclaimed at this Festival, in the Presence of the <i>French</i>
Ambassador, and was accordingly done with great Solemnity
on St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Day</i> in the Morning, at the East-Entrance
in the lower Ward of the Castle, at the top of
the Hill towards St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Chappel</i>; and to which
Place the Sovereign, in her whole Habit of the <i>Order</i>, (the
<i>French</i> Ambassador being near her,) with the five Officers
of the <i>Order</i>, and <i>Knights-Companions</i> before her, and before
them the Officers of Arms and Trumpets, proceeding
in a stately and well order’d Cavalcade; and after <i>Clarenceux</i>,
King of Arms, had ended the Proclamation, they
continu’d the Proceeding thence to the Chappel, in the
same State and Order.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the Practice and constant Usage of setting up Escutcheons
of Arms, since <i>Anno</i> 3 <i>Edward</i> VI. and at such
time as St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Day</i> was held elsewhere than at <i>Windsor</i>,
we have seen Variety of Testimonies.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Care of ordering and providing of which belong’d
to <i>Garter</i>; but the Sovereign of the <i>Order</i> was at the
Charge, (notwithstanding the said Order, <i>Anno</i> 3 <i>Edw.</i> VI.)
which heretofore we see was paid out of the Treasury in
the <i>Exchequer</i>; and since the Establishment of 1200 <i>l.
per Annum</i>, (settled by the late Sovereign King <i>Charles</i> I.
to discharge the ordinary and extraordinary Expences of
the <i>Order</i>,) the Allowance issu’d thence, and was paid by
the Chancellor of the <i>Order</i>; but now the Charge is plac’d
upon <i>Garter</i>, he having an Allowance therefore included
in the Augmentation of his Pension, <i>Anno</i> 15 <i>Car.</i> II.</p>

<p class='c000'>We find Privy Seals to have issu’d as high as the fifteenth
of Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>, for the Annual Allowance of
7 <i>l.</i> for Escutcheons imploy’d for the Use aforesaid, and
that the Price some time before was about that rate; for
the three and twenty Escutcheons, provided against St.
<i>George</i>’s <i>Feast</i>, <i>Anno</i> 1 and 2 <i>Phil.</i> and <i>Mar.</i> came to 6 <i>l.</i>
1 <i>s.</i> and 8 <i>d.</i> and those five and twenty set up the following
<span class='pageno' title='427' id='Page_427'></span>Year, 6 <i>l.</i> 11 <i>s.</i> and 8 <i>d.</i> some Differences then also
being in the Work, which enhanc’d the Price, <i>viz.</i> those
provided for Princes, at 6 <i>s.</i> and 8 <i>d.</i> a Piece, and each of
the rest at 5 <i>s.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>The Sovereign, the Prince of <i>Wales</i>, and Stranger
Kings and Princes, have accustomably had, at these
Times, Majesty Escutcheons set up over each of their Stalls;
but the rest of the <i>Knights-Companions</i>, Lodging Escutcheons
only; and we have seen an Account of some Majesty
Escutcheons prepar’d for every St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Feast</i>,
from 1613, to 1619; to wit, one for the Sovereign,
another for the King of <i>Denmark</i>, a third for the Prince
of <i>Wales</i>, and a fourth for <i>Frederick</i>, Count Palatine of
the <i>Rhine</i>, at 6 <i>s.</i> and 8 <i>d.</i> a piece; but so many <i>Knights-Companions</i>
as attended the Sovereign at those Feasts, had
each a Lodging Escutcheon, at 2 <i>s.</i> and 6 <i>d.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>From the Marshalling of Arms, quarter’d in the
<i>Knights-Companions</i> Escutcheons, and ordering their Stiles,
(printed always in <i>French</i>) there are several things no less
useful than worthy of Observation; for, first, though the
Plates of Arms and Quarterings, fix’d in each <i>Knight-Companion’s</i>
Stall at <i>Windsor</i>, continue there without Alteration,
or very seldom chang’d from that Order wherein
they were Marshall’d at that Time of their Installation;
yet these Escutcheons and Stiles Annually set up, do admit
of frequent Alteration, as there is Occasion; either
by adding more Quarterings, altering the Stiles, or amending
any thing that is amiss.</p>

<p class='c000'>For Instance: Whereas the Duke of <i>Savoy</i>, before 5
<i>Eliz.</i> bore <i>Gules a cross Argent</i>, it was then alter’d into five
Coats; that is to say, in the first Quarter, <i>Westphalia</i>, <i>Saxe-Moderne</i>
and <i>Angria</i>; in the second, <i>Chablais</i>; in the third,
<i>Aouste</i>, and the fourth as the first; and over all, in the
middle, the aforesaid Escutcheon of <i>Savoy</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Lord <i>Hunsdon</i> was install’d, <i>Anno</i> 3 <i>Eliz.</i>
he had twelve Coats of Arms, thus Marshall’d in his
Plate; four, four, and four; the first <i>Carey</i>, the second
<i>Spencer</i>, the third <i>Somerset</i>, the fourth <i>Bullen</i>, the fifth
<i>Ormond</i>, the sixth <i>Hoo</i>, the seventh <i>Rochford</i>, the eighth
<i>Seyntomer</i>, the ninth <i>Malmains</i>, the tenth <i>Wichingham</i>,
the eleventh St. <i>Leger</i>, and the twelfth <i>Hangford</i>; but
<i>Anno</i> 7 <i>Eliz.</i> his Escutcheon receiv’d an Addition of four
other Coats, <i>viz.</i> <i>Beuchamp</i>, <i>Warwick</i>, <i>Berkley</i>, and <i>Gerard</i>,
<span class='pageno' title='428' id='Page_428'></span>and they were inserted next to <i>Somerset</i>, the third
Coat in this said Plate.</p>

<p class='c000'>But on the contrary, where <i>Ambrose</i>, Earl of <i>Warwick</i>,
had twenty one Coats put into his Plate, <i>Anno</i> 5 <i>Eliz.</i>
and they Marshall’d in this Order, five, five, five, and six;
namely, first <i>Sutton</i>, second <i>Paganell</i>, third <i>Grey</i> of <i>Ruthin</i>,
fourth <i>Hastings</i>, fifth <i>Quincy</i>, sixth <i>Malpas</i>, seventh
<i>Somery</i>, eighth <i>Valence</i>, ninth <i>Talbott</i>, tenth <i>Warwick</i>, eleventh
<i>Beauchamp</i>, twelfth <i>Berkley</i>, thirteenth <i>Lisle</i>, fourteenth
<i>Gerard</i>, fifteenth <i>Guilford</i>, sixteenth <i>Houlden</i>, seventeenth
<i>West</i>, eigthteenth and nineteenth <i>Quarterly de la Ware</i>
and <i>Cantilupe</i>, twentieth <i>Mortimere</i> of <i>Wigmore</i>, and twenty
one <i>Greely</i>; at the Feast of St. <i>George</i> held at <i>White-Hall</i>,
<i>Anno</i> 9 <i>Eliz.</i> his Escutcheon contain’d but sixteen;
<i>viz.</i> four, four, four, and four; namely, first <i>Sutton</i>, second
<i>Paganell</i>, third <i>Somery</i>, fourth <i>Malpas</i>, fifth <i>Grey</i> of <i>Ruthin</i>,
sixth <i>Hastings</i>, seventh <i>Valence</i>, eighth <i>Ferrers</i>, ninth <i>Quincess</i>,
tenth <i>Chester</i>, eleventh <i>Talbott</i>, twelfth <i>Beauchamp</i>,
thirteenth <i>Warwick</i>, fourteenth <i>Berkley</i>, fifteenth <i>Gerard</i>,
sixteenth <i>Lisle</i>: So that there were seven Coats taken out
of the former; namely, <i>Guilford</i>, <i>Holden</i>, <i>West</i>, <i>de la Ware</i>
and <i>Cantilupe</i>, <i>Quarterly Mortimere</i> and <i>Greely</i>, and two added,
<i>viz.</i> <i>Ferrers</i> and <i>Chester</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the greatest and frequentest Variations are in the
Stiles and Titles of <i>Honour</i>, set under the Escutcheons,
and these relate unto, and are occasioned principally from
their attaining or resigning of Offices or Dignities.</p>

<p class='c000'>We find that the Stile set under the Escutcheon of <i>Ferdinand</i>
the Emperor, at St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Feast</i>, <i>Anno</i> 1 and 2
<i>Phil.</i> and <i>Mar.</i> was as followeth.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Du tres hault tres-Excellent &amp; tres-Puissant Prince, Ferdinand,
par la grace de Dieu, Roy des Romaines, de Hungarie,
&amp; Bohemie, Arch-Duc d’Austrie, Duc de Burgoigne</i>, &amp;c. <i>Chevalier
du tres-Noble Ordre de la Jarretiere.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>But <i>Anno</i> 5 <i>Eliz.</i> in the said Emperor’s Stile, the Titles
of King of <i>Hungary</i> and <i>Bohemia</i> were left out; because
<i>Maximilian</i> his Son had a little before obtain’d both those
Kingdoms.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Reign of Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>, the Stiles of <i>Philip</i>,
King of <i>Spain</i>, who, while Queen <i>Mary</i> lived, was Co-Sovereign
of this most Noble <i>Order</i>, run thus:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' title='429' id='Page_429'></span><i>Du tres Hault tres-Excellent and tres-Puissant Prince Philip,
par la grace de Dieu, Roy d’Espaigne, des Deux Cicels &amp;
Jerusalem, Arch-Duc d’Austriæ, Duc de Burgoigne, Millan,
&amp; Brabant, Compte de Hapsburghe, <a id='flanders' name='flanders'></a>Flanders, &amp;
Tiroll; Chevalier du tres-Noble Ordre de la Jarretiere.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>But at the Feasts of St. <i>George</i>, <i>Anno</i> 28, 29, and
30 <i>Eliz.</i> the Title of Catholick Prince was also given
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Instances relating to <i>Knights-Subjects</i> are very many;
there having been almost every Year some Additions, or
Omissions.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Duke of <i>Norfolk</i>’s Stile, <i>Anno</i> 3 <i>Eliz.</i> the <i>Lieutenantship
of the North</i> was omitted. In the Earl of <i>Rutland</i>’s,
at the same Feast, <i>President of the Council in the
Council in the North</i>, was added. The Marquiss of <i>Winchester</i>
caus’d the Title of Baron <i>St. John</i> to be omitted,
because his eldest Son bore that Title, and was a Baron of
Parliament.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be further observed, that a Stranger elect (having
receiv’d the <i>Habit</i> and <i>Ensigns</i> of the <i>Order</i>,) hath been
allow’d the Honour of having an Escutcheon of his Arms
set on the back of that Stall design’d for him, notwithstanding
he has not been install’d.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Of Adorning the Chappel.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 6. The Chappel where divine Service is celebrated,
at the Time of the Grand Feast; whether it be that of
St. <i>George</i>’s at <i>Windsor</i>, or elsewhere, as the Sovereign is
pleas’d, hath at all Times been adorn’d with rich Furniture;
the Care and Oversight whereof at <i>Windsor</i>, is committed
to the Dean of the College, but at other Places, to
the Dean of the Chappel.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>Altar</i>, by the Gift of pious Benefactors, was
adorned with Vessels, sumptuous both for their Materials
and Workmanship; but <i>temp. Hen.</i> VIII. and <i>Edw.</i> VI.
most of them were dispos’d of, so that King <i>James</i> I.·
taking notice that very little Plate, and other Ornaments,
were belonging to the Chappel, was pleas’d to make
some Provision for the adorning thereof, which was at
<span class='pageno' title='430' id='Page_430'></span>length effected by the free Contributions of the Knights
themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>For at a <i>Chapter</i> held at <i>White-Hall</i>, 16 <i>Jac.</i> I. it was
decreed, that every <i>Knight-Companion</i> should give to the
Use of the <i>Altar</i>, in the said Chappel, a piece of <i>Plate</i> of
the Value of 20 <i>l.</i> at the least.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Decree was confirm’d, <i>Anno</i> 6 <i>Car.</i> I. the Dean and
Canons of <i>Windsor</i> being impower’d to demand and receive
the Sums of Money, as above, which they were to
bestow in Plate for the Use of the <i>Altar</i>; and accordingly
they agreed for the Quantity of Plate hereafter mention’d,
which was deliver’d, <i>Anno</i> 1637. <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>But to make some farther Addition to the Glory of this
<i>Altar</i>, King <i>Charles</i> II. at the time of his <i>Installation</i>,
offer’d two large gilt Water-pots, weighing 387 Ounces
ten Peny Weight, amounting, by the excellent Workmanship,
to 12 <i>s.</i> the Ounce, and to the Sum of 232 <i>l.</i> 10 <i>s.</i>
Some sacred Ceremonies were perform’d at the Consecration
of this Plate, not very necessary to be spoke of here.
But all these, with the other Goods and Monuments belonging
to the King’s free Chappel and Treasury at <i>Windsor</i>,
were rifl’d and taken away by the Parliament Army.
King <i>Charles</i> II. therefore, after the Restauration, <i>Anno</i>
1667, by the Consent of the <i>Knights-Companions</i>, did levy
and collect, and by his own Bounty furnish’d the Chappel
again with the following Plate:</p>

<p class='c000'><i>A Pair of gilt Flaggons, bought with Money collected from
the</i> Knights Companions, 150 <i>Ounces.</i></p>

<p class='c000'><i>A Pair of wrought Flaggons, with great Bellies, having

<i>washing our Saviour’s Feet</i>, 198 <i>Ounces.</i></p>

  <h2 id='ch20' class='c005'>CAP. XX.<br /> <br /><i>The Order of the Ceremonies on the Eve of the Grand Feast.</i></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Of the beginning of the Grand Feast.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 1.</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c009'>The
Celebration of the Grand Feast, with the
Ceremonies, devis’d to set forth and illustrate
the Glory thereof, hath been worthy the observation
of the first Institutor, and all succeeding Sovereigns;
well knowing that what is once slightly observ’d
will soon fall into disesteem, if not into contempt. Therefore
they have been very particular to the Day, the Hour,
<span class='pageno' title='434' id='Page_434'></span>and the Place, where the Sovereign and <i>Knights-Companions</i>
are to meet.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the first, although St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Day</i> (or such other
Day as the Sovereign shall please to nominate and appoint,
by Prorogation in lieu thereof,) be the Principal and
Grand Day of the Feast, yet the Eve of that Day does
the Feast take Commencement, and determines not till
the third Day following; the whole Solemnity taking
up three Days inclusively.</p>

<p class='c000'>And this is clear from several Articles of the <i>Statutes</i>,
wherein the course of the Ceremonies to be observ’d at
the Grand Solemnity are set down; whether observed,
on the Eve, the Feast-Day, or the Morrow after: And
these three Days together did the Sovereign hold the
Grand Feast, whether they personally celebrated the same,
or deputed other of the <i>Knights-Companions</i> to that Employment,
the cause of the Commissions of Deputation
limitting their Power either in general, <i>during the time of
the Feast</i>; or in particular, upon the Day of St. <i>George</i>,
the Day, and that following, <i>viz.</i> the last Day of the
Feast. In like manner, when in succeeding Times, Commissions
of Prorogation of the Grand Feast were made
use of, we find the three Days continuance of the
Feast to be particularly mentioned in the Body of
those Commissions: Namely, the Day wherein, by such
Appointment, the Feast was to begin, the Grand Day it
self, and the Day whereon it ended.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Directions given in the <i>Statutes</i>, for the Order and
Course of this Solemnity, to begin with the Eve, run
thus: Every Year upon St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Eve</i>, shall be an Assembly,
or Meeting of all the <i>Knights-Companions</i> of the
<i>Order</i>, at <i>Windsor Castle, &amp;c.</i> and the same is positively
enjoin’d by all the other Bodies of the <i>Statutes</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>And as the Grand Feast is generally said to Commence <i>in
Vigilia Sancti Georgii</i>, or as it is otherwise exprest in the
<i>Black-Book</i>, in <i>Vigilia in future celebratis</i>, or, <i>Vigiliis
Divi Georgii</i>, or in <i>Vigilia Festi</i>. So has the time of this
preceeding Day several other Denominations given it
in the same <i>Register</i>, <i>Vesper ante Diem Sancti Georgii</i>;
<i>in Vesperiis Georgianis</i>, <i>in Vesperiis Festi</i>, <i>in Vesperiis Commitionem</i>;
and at other times, <i>pridie Divi Georgii</i>, <i>pridie
Georgianæ Solemnitatis</i>, <i>pridie Festi</i>, <i>pridie feriarum Divi
Georgii</i>, and sometimes <i>per vigilia</i>, and lastly in plain
<span class='pageno' title='435' id='Page_435'></span><i>English</i>, St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Eve</i>; all which signify one and the
same thing, and are but various Names given to the
Evening of the Day foregoing either that of St. <i>George</i>,
or that whereon the Grand Feast is appointed to be held
by Prorogation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus we see that the Founder began his Solemnity
upon the Eve of the Feast Day; which doubtless was in
conformity to the Custom of the Church, who made the
<i>Vigils</i> and <i>Eves</i> part of the ensuing Festivals, and as
Ushers to the Grand Solemnities.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the Eve was appointed by the Founder for the
Commencement of the Anniversary of the Grand Feast,
so to make the time more certain, the <i>Statutes</i> express the
exact Hour of meeting for beginning the Solemnities,
to be at the Hour of <i>Tierce</i>, which in many other Places
is called, <i>Hora Tertiarum</i>. But this seemed not sufficient
to express clear enough the meaning of a Law, where a
Penalty was enjoined, and therefore at a <i>Chapter</i> held at
<i>Windsor</i>, 17 <i>Edw.</i> IV. a scruple arising among the <i>Knights-Companions</i>,
concerning the Words <i>Hora Tertiarum</i>, whether
they were intended to mean three in the Afternoon,
or at the Hour of the Church, generally used after
Prime Noon before; and fixed it to the latter.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>Registrum Chartaceum</i> Records the same Explanation
of the Words; and to let us see that ’twas immediately
put in Practice, it is there entered with the Names
of those <i>Knights-Companions</i> present with the Sovereign,
both in the Morning and Evening of the same Day.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another Instance of which there is, 3 <i>Hen.</i> VII. on
the Eve of the Grand Feast, held by Prorogation at
<i>Windsor</i>, where the Sovereign, in regard of the arrival of
several Ambassadors, put off the usual <i>Chapter</i> till Noon;
whence it is evident, that the Custom at this time was
likewise to begin the Solemnity in the Morning.</p>

<p class='c000'>But notwithstanding the said Decree of King <i>Edw.</i> IV.
we find it <i>Anno</i> 11 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. to be meant and intended
for three in the Afternoon. And when King <i>Henry</i> VIII.
came to Model the <i>Statutes</i> of the <i>Order</i>, in two several
Articles, he declares and expounds the <i>Hora Tertia</i>, (which
the <i>English</i> Version of those <i>Statutes</i> renders the <i>Hour</i> of
<i>Tierce</i>,) to be the <i>Hora Tertia post Merediem</i>, three in the
Afternoon; and in another Article of the same <i>Statutes</i>,
<i>Hora Tertiarum, id est, Hora Tertiarum post Merediem</i>;
<span class='pageno' title='436' id='Page_436'></span>and elsewhere, <i>Hora Tertia Vespertina vel Pomeridiana</i>;
which Hour, as it was then settled to be the punctual
time for the <i>Knights-Companions</i> meeting, to enter on the
Solemnity of the Feast, so has it ever since continued unaltered,
and usually observed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Place of Assembly for the Sovereign and <i>Knights-Companions</i>,
hath usually been in such of the Sovereign’s
Privy Lodgings, both at <i>Windsor</i>, or elsewhere, as he
hath appointed; frequently in the Privy, Withdrawing,
or Bed Chambers: To this appointed Place the <i>Knights-Companions</i>
repair, to give their Attendance on the Sovereign,
having first invested themselves in full Robes,
either in their own Lodgings, or some convenient Room
at Court, where <i>Garter</i> is to attend them, with notice of
the approaching Hour.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>Knights-Companions</i> being come to the Sovereign,
as likewise the Officers of the <i>Order</i>, habited in their
<i>Mantles</i>, and bearing in their Hands the <i>Symbols</i> of their
several Offices, they wait the Sovereign’s being vested in
his Robes, till he passes into the Presence Chamber,
or give beginning to the Feast, by opening the <i>Chapter</i> at
their meeting, before he goes thither.</p>

<p class='c000'>About the same time, the Provincial <i>Kings</i>, <i>Heralds</i>,
and <i>Pursuivants</i>, wearing their Coats of the Sovereign’s
Arms; so also the Band of Pensioners, armed with their
Pole Axes, Assemble in the Presence Chamber; but the
Prebends of the College, vested in their Taffaty Mantles
over their Surplices, and <i>Alms-Knights</i> in their <i>Mantles</i>
and <i>Surcoats</i>, come no nearer than the Guard Chamber.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lastly, The Servants and Attendants of the <i>Knights-Companions</i>
meet without the Guard Chamber Door, whence
spreading themselves down the Stairs, through the Stone
Gallery, into the upper Ward of the Castle, or as far as
their Number will reach, all wait the Sovereign’s coming
forth into the Presence.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will be necessary here to inform the Reader, in regard
not only the Feast Day of St. <i>George</i>, but the
Grand Feast held in Honour of the <i>Order</i>, hath been kept
in several other Places besides <i>Windsor Castle</i>, more particularly,
at <i>White-Hall</i>, St. <i>James</i>’s, <i>Greenwich</i>, and <i>York</i>;
that there are many Ceremonies, and other Particulars hereafter
named, which alter not with the Place; but appertain
to the Festival, and are therefore to be observed every
<span class='pageno' title='437' id='Page_437'></span>where alike; as for instance, the form of Proceeding,
the manner of holding <i>Chapters</i>, the Ceremony of Offering
Gold and Silver, Swearing of Officers, and such
like: But others there are, which are precisely local and
particular, as the <i>Prebends</i> and <i>Alms-Knights</i> going in
the Proceeding, the Offering up of Atchievements, <i>&amp;c.</i>
to <i>Windsor</i> only.</p>

<p class='c000'>Since the withdrawing the Grand Feast from <i>Windsor</i>,
some of the Officers of Arms, curious in the Observation
of these Solemnities, performed in other Places, have
afforded us great Plenty of Memorials, relating to the ceremonious
Part thereof, while the same was continued
at <i>Windsor</i>; and therefore, when the true Place where the
Instance lies, shall be also cited, the Reader is not to conclude
that the Precedent urged doth not full enough answer
the Purpose, unless it had been likewise fetched
from <i>Windsor</i>. But that in this case, the Ceremony or
Example is such, as is peculiar to the Feast, not the Place,
and ought to be observed without alteration at any Place,
where the Sovereign shall keep the Grand Feast.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Of setting the Proceeding in Order.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 2. In Times past, the <i>Knights-Companions</i> appeared
at the Grand Feast, attended with a numerous Train of
Servants and other Dependents; but the Feast having removed
from <i>Windsor</i> to other Places, much of this ancient
Splendor was laid aside; yet upon King <i>James</i> I. Accession
to the Crown, somewhat of this Glory began to
revive; for we find it entered upon the <i>Register</i>, in the
fourth of his Reign; <i>That the ancient Custom, which for some
Years had been intermitted, wherein, at the Solemnity of
this Feast, all the</i> Knights-Companions <i>were wont to go attended,
each with a large Train, was recalled and brought
back into use</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>But this heighth of Gallantry and Splendor in the Number
of Attendants, and richness of their Apparel, within
ten Years grew up to such Excess, or rather Exorbitancy,
that it required a restraint; wherefore the Sovereign, by
the unanimous Advice of the <i>Knights-Companions</i>, Decreed,
and Commanded, <i>That every one of the</i> Knights-Companions
<i>of the</i> Order, <i>should have to attend upon his Person
<span class='pageno' title='438' id='Page_438'></span>at the yearly Solemnization of the Feast of the</i> Order, <i>fifty
Persons, and no more</i>: The reason whereof we find elsewhere
noted to be, for saving of Charge, and avoiding of
Emulation. But in the beginning of King <i>Charles</i> I.
Reign, of ever Blessed Memory, the gallantry of Attendants
began again to Increase and Augment; insomuch
that at the Grand Feast held at <i>White-Hall</i>, the 22d, 23d,
and 24th of <i>April</i>, <i>Anno</i> 8 <i>Car.</i> I. we find it observed,
that the <i>Knights-Companions</i> came forth attended, each
with a Train of Servants very richly clad.</p>

<p class='c000'>But to return and enter upon the Proceeding, to the end
the Servants and Attendants of the <i>Knights-Companions</i>
may be exactly Marshalled, the Usher of the Hall (whose
Duty it is to rank them) ought to call for a List from <i>Garter</i>,
of such <i>Knights-Companions</i> as are to be present at
the Grand Feast, noted with their several Places in the
Proceeding, for his better Directions in assigning the Attendants
their due Places, the Order whereof is thus: First,
the <i>Junior</i> Knights-Attendants proceed one before another,
on the left Hand, upon whose right Hand the second
eldest Knights-Attendants go in equal Rank with
them, for this we observe to have been the general rule;
where the <i>Knights-Companions</i> Proceed in pairs, their Attendants
go together; those belonging to the <i>Senior</i> Knights
of the two, on the right Hand, and to the <i>Junior</i> upon
their left; but the Order is otherwise, where any of the
<i>Knights-Companions</i> proceed single and alone, (which often
falls out, as shall be noted in its due Place,) for then
the Attendants belonging to that single Knight go two
and two, on both sides the Way, opposite one against
the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>But when the Grand Feast is Celebrated at <i>White-Hall</i>,
there the <i>Knights-Companions</i> Attendants are Marshalled
by the said Usher, on both sides the Passage, from
the outward Door of the Guard Chamber, down into the
Hall, taking up all the Room as far as the old Chappel;
and because here they do not proceed, in regard of the
shortness of the Processional way, but only make a stand,
for the Proceeding to pass through them, they are ranked
in a way different from that used at <i>Windsor</i>; nevertheless
relating more especially to the Order observed by
their Masters: Which Method, in the Sovereign’s Proceeding
to the Chappel, at the beforementioned Feast,
<span class='pageno' title='439' id='Page_439'></span>held at <i>White-Hall</i>, <i>Anno</i> 8 <i>Car.</i> I. we find thus described.
The eldest <i>Knight-Companions</i> Servants were ranked on
the right Hand of the Passage, the chiefest of them near
unto the old Chappel Door; and the second Knight (being
Companion to the eldest) his Attendants stood on the
left side, the chiefest of them also next the said old Chappel
Door, and in case the eldest Knight’s Fellow or Companion
be not present in this Proceeding, then the eldest
Knight’s Servants ought to be placed opposite one against
the other, upon each side the said old Chappel Door:
The like Order is to be taken in Marshalling the Servants
of the other Knights of this most Noble <i>Order</i>, whose
Companions are then absent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Secondly, The Order of Proceeding amongst the <i>Alms-Knights</i>,
(who, <i>Anno</i> 1 <i>Car.</i> I. had two Waiters of the
Sovereign’s Hall, in their Livery Coats, bearing white Rods
in their Hands, to proceed before them,) is in general
two and two together, the <i>Junior</i> is placed foremost on the
left Hand, and his next <i>Senior</i> on his right; and if Sickness,
or other lawful Impediment, chance to hinder one
or more of them, from going in the Proceeding, his <i>Junior</i>
is advanc’d into his Place, and consequently all the
other <i>Juniors</i> do in like manner alter their Places, and
advance, to the end the superior Place be still supplied,
according to the right rule of Marshalling the Singles,
that compose a gross Body; but in this Case, if the
Number that attend happen to be odd, the Governor of
the <i>Alms-Knights</i> goes last of all, and alone.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thirdly, The Virger of the College hath his Place
next after the <i>Alms-Knights</i>, and immediately before the
<i>Prebends</i> of the College; who being habited in a Gown,
beareth a Silver Verge, the Ensign of his Office: Nevertheless,
heretofore, when the <i>Prebends</i> went not in the
Proceeding, on the Eve of the Grand Feast, the Virger
proceeded first of all, before the <i>Alms-Knights</i>, for so it
was observed on the Eve of St. <i>George</i>, at <i>Windsor</i>, <i>Anno</i>
6 <i>Eliz.</i> and in this manner we see it exprest, in the Proceeding
set forth by <i>Marcus Gerchard</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fourthly, Under the general rule, relating to the <i>Alms-Knights</i>,
are comprehended the <i>Prebends</i> of the College,
the <i>Pursuivants</i>, <i>Heralds</i>, and <i>Provincial Kings</i>, insomuch,
that where either of the said Kings are absent, the <i>Senior
Herald</i> is advanced, and goes in breast on the left Hand of
<span class='pageno' title='440' id='Page_440'></span>him who is then present; so also where any of the <i>Heralds</i>
are wanting, his next <i>Junior</i> ascendeth into his
Place; whereby it sometimes falls out, that the <i>Senior
Pursuivant</i> is joined to the left Hand of the <i>Junior Herald</i>:
And through their defects and absence, the Number of
the Officers of Arms be odd, then (with this difference in
the foresaid rule observed among the <i>Alms-Knights</i>,) the
youngest <i>Pursuivant</i> goeth single by himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>Touching the right of Precedency, between the Officers
of Arms, and <i>Prebends</i> of the College, in Proceeding
before the Sovereign and <i>Knights-Companions</i>, we find
there hath been heretofore not only some Question started,
but the Place contended for; insomuch, that at the
Installation of the Earls of <i>Shrewsbury</i> and <i>Cumberland</i>,
<i>Anno</i> 34 <i>Eliz.</i> the <i>Prebends</i> took Place, and upon the 24th
of <i>May, Anno</i> 39 <i>Eliz.</i> at the Installation of <i>Thomas</i>, Lord
<i>Howard</i> of <i>Walden</i>, and others, the <i>Prebends</i> again endeavoured
to pass between the Officers of Arms, and Officers
of the <i>Order</i>; but <i>Charles</i>, Lord <i>Howard</i> of <i>Effingham</i>,
then Lieutenant to the Sovereign, delivered his
Opinion on the behalf of the Officers of Arms against the
<i>Prebends</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet did not this so settle the <i>Order</i> of Precedency, or
quiet the <i>Prebends</i>, but that the Contention again broke
out, <i>Anno</i> 1 <i>Jac.</i> I. at the Installation of the Earls of <i>Pembrook</i>,
<i>Marr</i>, <i>Southampton</i>, and Duke of <i>Lenox</i>; (which
happened on the ninth, not second of <i>July</i>, in the foresaid
Year,) even to such a heighth, that the <i>Prebends</i>, <i>Pursuivants</i>,
and <i>Heralds</i>, contended in the Proceeding; but
the Controversy was on the next Morning composed, by
the Lord Admiral, (then the Sovereign’s Lieutenant,) the
Lord Treasurer, and the Earl of <i>Worcester</i>; and the <i>Order</i>
in Proceeding thus settled: first, That the <i>Alms-Knights</i>
should go foremost, the <i>Pursuivants</i> next, then the <i>Prebends</i>,
and then the <i>Heralds</i> and Kings of Arms; and this
Order in Proceeding was afterwards observed, on the
21 <i>May, Anno</i> 4 <i>Jac.</i> I. at the Installation of the Earl of
<i>Salisbury</i>, and Viscount <i>Bindon</i>; as also the 19 <i>May, Anno</i>
6. of the same King, at the Installation of the Earls of
<i>Dunbar</i>, and <i>Montgomery</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Howbeit, <i>Anno</i> 9 <i>Jac.</i> I. and so afterwards, we do not
find the <i>Pursuivants</i> mentioned in the Proceeding, by particular
Name, nor otherwise, than in this following Order,
<span class='pageno' title='441' id='Page_441'></span><i>viz.</i> <i>Alms-Knights</i>, <i>Prebends</i>, <i>Heralds</i>, &amp;c. but it may
be presumed that the <i>Pursuivants</i>, then joined again in
Body with the <i>Heralds</i>, (though for some Years before divided
from them, by the interposition of the <i>Prebends</i>,)
as well as the Provincial Kings, and all of them under the
Title of <i>Heralds</i>, and sometimes Officers of Arms.</p>

<p class='c000'>And though at the Grand Feast held by Prorogation, on
Sunday the 14th of <i>September</i>, in the said fifteenth Year
of King <i>James</i>, it is noted, that the Prince (being then
the Sovereign’s Lieutenant,) proceeded to Morning Service
on the Feast Day, with the <i>Alms-Knights</i>, <i>Heralds</i>,
<i>Prebends</i>, and Officers of the <i>Order</i> before him; from
which manner of Expression, it may perchance be supposed,
that the <i>Heralds</i> went at that time next after the
<i>Alms-Knights</i>, and before the <i>Prebends</i>; nevertheless, elsewhere
we find them, on the Eve of the aforesaid Feast,
ranked in this following Order.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The Alms-Knights.</div>
      <div class='line'>The Prebends.</div>
      <div class='line'>The Officers of Arms.</div>
      <div class='line'>The Knights of the Order, <i>&amp;c.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And doubtless, they proceeded in the same Order to the
Chappel, on the next Morning, notwithstanding what is
before said to the contrary, those Expressions being interwoven
with the general Account given of the Ceremonies
of the whole Festival, and more subject to mistake, where
the relation of the Proceeding is carried on in a continued
Discourse, than were ranked (as is before exhibited,) in
particular Lines, and in the Order and Form of a Proceeding.
Besides, we no where meet with any Order or
Decree, nulling the foresaid Determination, made <i>Anno</i>
1 <i>Jac.</i> I. which placeth the <i>Prebends</i> before the <i>Heralds</i>.
Finally, to give an end to the Disputes in this Point,
we find, that upon the Eve of this Feast, held at <i>Windsor</i>,
the 23, 24, and 25 of <i>November</i>, <i>Anno</i> 1 <i>Car.</i> I. the <i>Prebends</i>
proceeded next before the <i>Pursuivants</i>, and the
<i>Pursuivants</i> immediately before the <i>Heralds</i> and Provincial
Kings; that is to say, all the Officers of Arms (except
<i>Garter</i>, whose Place is elsewhere,) proceeded in one entire
Body together, which Order we find to be the same
in all Proceedings after, that we have met with, and was
<span class='pageno' title='442' id='Page_442'></span>so observed at the Grand Feast held at <i>Windsor</i>, <i>Anno</i> 13
<i>Car.</i> II. and ever since. But to proceed.</p>

<p class='c000'>All the before mentioned Attendants wait in their several
Stations, till the Hour of <i>Tierce</i>, when the Sovereign
(having the <i>Knights-Companions</i> and Officers of the
<i>Order</i> before him, and his Train carried up,) passeth towards
the Presence Chamber, notice of whose coming
being given, the Band of Pensioners make the accustomed
Guard and Passage along the Presence Chamber, the <i>Seniors</i>
standing towards the Lobby Door, within which
Guard, on the other side, the Officers of Arms place
themselves: Upon the same warning, the Yeomen of the
Guard clear a like Passage from the Presence Chamber
Door, along the Guard Chamber, unto its outward Door,
for the Proceeding to pass through.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the Sovereign’s approach, one of the Gentlemen
Ushers attended with the Sword of State, (the Point resting
upon the Ground,) delivereth to such one of the Nobility,
(not being a Knight of the <i>Order</i>,) whom the Sovereign,
as an honorary Favour, hath before nominated,
to bear it from thence, before him in all the Proceedings
of the Feast; during which Action, the <i>Knights-Companions</i>
proceed forwards, and being entred the Presence
Chamber, Flank on each side the State, with some small
distance between them, and there make a stand: The Sovereign
being also entred, passeth to the Step before the
State, (the Nobleman who beareth the Sword, and the
five Officers of the <i>Order</i>, retiring a little on his right Hand,)
and then turning himself towards the <i>Knights-Companions</i>,
standeth there a while, until they have made their Reverences
unto him; which being performed, he resaluteth
the <i>Knights-Companions</i> by putting off his Cap: This done,
the Sovereign putteth his Cap on again; whereupon every
of the <i>Knights Companions</i> putteth on theirs, and immediately
Rank themselves, according to their due Place,
on both sides the State.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the right understanding whereof, we are in the
fifth place to Note, that in the Order and Method wherein
the <i>Knights-Companions</i> are ranked, (if they be all present,)
is two and two together, the <i>Junior</i> foremost on
the left Hand, for that is his Place in all Proceedings;
but where any of them be absent, the rule is different
from that appropriate to the before-mentioned Degrees;
<span class='pageno' title='443' id='Page_443'></span>for though it be recorded, that upon the Eve of the Grand
Feast held at <i>Windsor</i>, <i>Anno</i> 7 <i>Hen.</i> V. the <i>Knights-Companions</i>
went in Order to the <i>Chapter-House</i> and <i>Choir</i>;
yet this being exprest but in general terms, how it ought
to be understood, will more fully appear, from the particular
Directions given for the Order of the <i>Knights-Companions</i>
Proceeding in King <i>Henry</i> VIII’s Statutes;
where the Law directs each <i>Knight-Companion</i> to proceed
alone, at such time as his Fellow (who possesseth the Stall
opposite unto him) is absent, but the Order of such
Proceeding will by a Scheme be made more evident.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus four <i>Knights-Companions</i> proceeded alone, in regard
the Stalls opposite to them were void, the three first
being absent, and the last void by the Death of the Earl
of <i>Huntington</i>; and to avoid all disputes in relation to
Precedency, King <i>Henry</i> VIII. Decreed, in the sixteenth
Year of his Reign; <i>That each</i> Knight-Companion <i>should
take Place, in Procession, Station, or sitting at the Table,
thence forward, as he had his Seat or Stall in the Choir, and
not according to the Degree of his Birth or Condition, unless
the Sovereign was pleased that any should be made Choice of,
according to the Nobility of his Family, to sit at the end of
his own Table, or perform any other thing by the by</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Proceeding among the Officers of the <i>Order</i> differeth
from all before spoken of; for, being five in Number,
the three inferior Officers (when all present,) March
in a breast, and (of later Times,) the <i>Register</i> in the middle,
<span class='pageno' title='444' id='Page_444'></span><i>Garter</i> on his right Hand, and the <i>Usher</i> of the <i>Black-Rod</i>
on his left.</p>

<p class='c000'>After these three Officers, the two superior proceed
together, the <i>Prelate</i> on the Right, and the <i>Chancellor</i> on
the left; and after, the Officers of the <i>Order</i> follow the
Sword, which is carried immediately before the Sovereign.
In the beginning of Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>’s Reign, it was born
by some of the Barons, but of later Times it hath been
conferr’d on Persons of higher Rank, as <i>Anno</i> 4 <i>Car.</i> I.
on the Earl of <i>Dover</i>; <i>Anno</i> 9 <i>Car.</i> I. on the Earl of <i>Danby</i>;
and <i>Anno</i> 13 <i>Car.</i> II. on the Lord Viscount <i>Mordant</i>, then
Constable of the Castle of <i>Windsor</i>; and at this Time ’tis
usually born by none under the Degree of an Earl.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sovereign’s Place in the Proceeding, <i>&amp; notandum
quod superior Ordinis tempore Processionis in dicta Capella
transibit retro totam Sociarum Comitivam</i>; which though
the <i>Statute</i> mentions here to be performed at the Grand
Procession, yet it refers to all those times the Sovereign
proceeds to, or from, no less than within the Chappel.
In ancient Time, the Sovereign (if he were at <i>Windsor</i>, to
celebrate the Grand Feast,) proceeded to the Chappel in
Person, as well on the Eve, as on the Feast Day. Queen
<i>Elizabeth</i> being the first who went not to the Chappel on
the Eve of the Feast, unless we except King <i>Henry</i> VI.
who, by reason of Sickness, was necessitated to make a
Deputy in his stead: The aforesaid Omission of Queen
<i>Elizabeth</i>, was first occasioned through Indisposition of
Health, though she afterwards, without that necessity, did
not comply, as in the 18, 25, 29, and 31 Years of her
Reign, which gave occasion to King <i>James</i> to make Deputies
at those three Grand Feasts he Celebrated at <i>Windsor</i>;
and the like did King <i>Charles</i> I. in the first Year of
his Reign; but in the fourth Year of his Reign, the ancient
Custom (for many Years intermitted,) was restored,
and the Sovereign (making no Lieutenant,) proceeded to
the Chappel, not only on that Eve, but always observed
it afterwards, as did King <i>Charles</i> II. in all the Grand
Feasts he held, and is now observed.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will be necessary to take notice, that the Proceeding
begins from the Presence Chamber, call’d in the <i>Statutes</i>
the Great Chamber; a Scheme whereof, on the Eve of
the Grand Feast, is here exhibited.</p>

<p class='c008'>To the foregoing Proceeding have been occasionally
receiv’d some Persons of Quality, and others Eminent in
Place and Degree; (though their Offices do not particularly
relate to this most Noble <i>Order</i>,) but are admitted by
reason of their requisite Attendance on the Sovereign, in
his Proceedings on all Occasions.</p>

<p class='c000'>On St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Eve</i>, <i>Anno</i> 3 <i>Eliz.</i> the old Ambassador
of <i>Sweden</i>, accompanied by the Earl of <i>Hertford</i>, went
in the Proceeding to the Closet at <i>White-Hall</i>, next after
the Train-bearers, and immediately before the Ladies Attendants
on the Sovereign; and the next Morning, when
the Sovereign proceeded to the Chappel, the new Ambassador
of <i>Sweden</i> went in the same Place.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to those admitted on the Account of their Offices,
is the Lord Chamberlain, (though not a Knight of the
<i>Garter</i>,) and is allowed Place somewhat behind, on the
right Hand of the Sovereign, and the Vice Chamberlain
on the left.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dean of the Sovereign’s Chappel at <i>White-Hall</i>
attends when the Proceedings are thither, going a little
behind the Sovereign towards his left Hand; next goes
the Clerk of the Closet, then the Master of the Robes,
as also one of the Masters of Requests, and then the
Gentlemen of the Robes.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' title='446' id='Page_446'></span>
<h3 class='c010'><i>Of the Proceeding to the</i> Chapter-House.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>§ 3. Having under the precedent Head, treated at
large of the Rank and Place of all those that pass in the
Proceeding, wherein all are Bare-headed, except the Sovereign
and <i>Knights-Companions</i>: I now come to the Place
whither the Proceeding is directed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first Solemn Action on the Entrance of the Grand
Feast, which the Sovereign and <i>Knights-Companions</i> are
obliged to perform, is to Celebrate a <i>Chapter</i>, to which
end it hath been most usual for them to proceed from the
Presence Chamber, <i>every one in their due Place and Order</i>;
first to the <i>Chapter-House</i>, to consult of things of course;
and next into the <i>Choir</i>, to hear Divine Service; which
has been the constant Custom from the Reign of King
<i>Henry</i> V. as many Examples, recorded in the Registers of
the <i>Order</i>, evidence.</p>

<p class='c000'>As this Custom of holding a <i>Chapter</i> on the Eve of the
Grand Feast, was constantly observed when celebrated
without Prorogation; so also hath a <i>Chapter</i> been in like
manner held before <i>Vespers</i>, on the Eve, at such time
as the Feast Day of St. <i>George</i> only hath been observ’d,
when (for any cause) the Anniversary of the Grand Feast
receiv’d Prorogation: As for Instance, <i>Anno</i> 1 <i>Mary</i>, a
<i>Chapter</i> was held at the Mannor of St. <i>James</i>’s, on the
<i>Vigil</i> of St. <i>George</i>, before the first <i>Vespers</i>; whereunto is
fixt this Note, <i>ut moris est</i>; and the Grand Feast for
that Year receiv’d Adjournment, until the coming of
<i>Philip</i>, then Prince (after King) of <i>Spain</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In like manner, though the Celebration of the Grand
Feasts were removed from <i>Windsor</i>, and observed at other
Places, yet this usual Custom of holding a <i>Chapter</i> on the
Eve, was always practised; after which the proceeding
to Evening Prayer succeeded, as is manifest by several
Testimonies from the <i>Registers</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The publick processional way to the <i>Chapter-House</i> at
<i>Windsor</i>, used Time out of Mind, led from the Presence
Chamber through the Cloister, and the great Gate of the
King’s Lodging, to the upper Ward of the Castle, thence
through the middle Ward, and part of the lower, to and
through the Passage, between the East End of the Chappel
<span class='pageno' title='447' id='Page_447'></span>and <i>Tomb-House</i>; and thence into the <i>Chapter-House</i>, Situate
on the North East Corner of St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Chappel</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the Sovereign hath sometimes thought fit to wave
this publick processional way, and pass along the private
way, which leads from the King’s Privy Chamber, down
the Stairs into the Terrace, <i>viz.</i> through that stately Walk
lying on the North side of the Castle, and entring again
at a Door, heretofore made through a part of the Castle
Wall into one of the Canons Lodgings, adjoining to <i>Winchester
Tower</i>, (now made up) went thence through the
Cloisters, proceeding in the Order before shewed.</p>

<p class='c000'>We shall close this Head, with observing, that though
the Proceedings to the <i>Chapter-House</i> or Chappel, on the
Eve of the Feast, have most commonly been on Foot;
yet have they been also on Horse-back, on extraordinary
Occasions, as <i>Anno</i> 3 <i>Hen.</i> VII. at which Time several
Ambassadors being arrived here from Foreign Kings
and Princes, they and many of the Nobility of this Kingdom,
with the King’s Council, the two Archbishops, the
Bishops of <i>Lincoln</i> and <i>Ely</i>, and the Chief Justice of the
King’s Bench, repaired also thither; and on the Eve, the
Sovereign, accompanied with the <i>Knights-Companions</i>, rode
from the upper Quadrangle down to the College. The
Queen and the King’s Mother rode in a Chair, covered
with rich Cloth of Gold, drawn by six Coursers finely
Harnass’d, and twenty one Ladies, habited in Crimson
Velvet, rode on white Palfries: Sir <i>Roger Cotton</i>, Master
of the Queen’s Horse, led her Horse of State, whereon
was a Saddle of Cloth of Gold, and three Crowns of
Silver gilt; as soon as they alighted, the Sovereign and
<i>Knights-Companions</i> proceeded to the <i>Chapter-House</i>, and
thence to Evening Song, which ended, they return’d in
the Order they came.</p>

<p class='c000'>King <i>Henry</i> VIII. in the eleventh Year of his Reign,
at three a Clock in the Afternoon, with all the <i>Knights-Companions</i>,
in the Habit of the <i>Order</i>, proceeded from
the Presence Chamber in <i>Windsor-Castle</i>, till they came
to the Quadrangle, where they took their Horses, and
rode according to their Stalls, not according to their
Estate, next before the King, and thence rode to the
middle Door of the Chappel, and there alighted, and proceeded
without the <i>Choir</i> to the <i>Chapter-House</i>; there are
other Examples, but these may suffice.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' title='448' id='Page_448'></span>
<h3 class='c010'><i>Of the opening of the</i> Chapter.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>§ 4. The Proceeding being arriv’d at the Entrance
into the Chappel, first the Attendants on the <i>Knights-Companions</i>
divide themselves as they enter, beginning at
the outward Door, and Flank on each side the North Isle
of the Chappel, and so toward the West Door of the
<i>Choir</i>, making a stand along the Isle for the <i>Alms-Knights</i>,
<i>Virgers</i>, <i>Prebends</i>, and <i>Officers</i> of <i>Arms</i>, to pass through
them, who go on towards the said West Door; and when
the <i>Junior Knights-Companions</i> are entred into the Chappel,
the Proceeding makes a stand, while all the <i>Knights-Companions</i>
following turn aside on the right Hand into the
<i>Chapter-House</i>, next the Officers of the <i>Order</i>, and lastly
the Sovereign; but the Nobleman that carries the Sword,
the Train-bearers, Pensioners, <i>&amp;c.</i> stay without the <i>Chapter-House</i>
Door in the North Isle; none being admitted in
but the Sovereign, the <i>Knights-Companions</i>, and the Officers
of the <i>Order</i>; who being all entred, the Door is
shut by the Gentleman Usher of the <i>Black-Rod</i>, and every
Person severally takes his due Place and Station, whereupon
the <i>Chapter</i> immediately opens.</p>

<p class='c000'>In what Manner and Order the Sovereign, <i>Knights-Companions</i>,
and Officers of the <i>Order</i>, are ranked, at the
holding of a <i>Chapter</i>, is describ’d, <i>Anno</i> 11 <i>Hen.</i> VIII.
when the Sovereign and <i>Knights-Companions</i> consulted in
the <i>Chapter-House</i>, on the Reformation and Explanation
of the <i>Statutes</i> of the <i>Order</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sovereign, on his Entrance, proceeded to the midst
of the North-end of the Table; the <i>Knights-Companions</i>,
whose Stalls in the <i>Choir</i> were on the Sovereign’s side,
took the right Hand of the Table, and those of the Princes
side the left; then the Prelate of the <i>Order</i> came and stood
on the Sovereign’s right Hand, at the corner of the Table;
<i>Register</i> and <i>Garter</i> were at the lower end, and <i>Black-Rod</i>
kept the <i>Chapter-House</i> Door on the inside. The Chancellor
of the <i>Order</i> is not there mention’d, (as not being
present) yet his Place is on the Sovereign’s left Hand of
the Table.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the Sovereign and <i>Knights-Companions</i> arrive at the
<i>Chapter-House</i> so late, that the Business necessary to be done
<span class='pageno' title='449' id='Page_449'></span>cannot be discuss’d, without putting off the Celebration of
<i>Vespers</i>, beyond the Canonical Hour; it hath been usual
to adjourn the Debates till the next Morning, as was done
<i>Anno</i> 14 <i>Car.</i> I.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Transactions in the</i> Chapter <i>held before the</i> Vespers.</h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 5. When the <i>Chapter</i> held before the <i>Vespers</i> is opened,
and no Adjournment given thereto, all things are
then to be provided for, which concern the Honour and
Dignity of this most Noble <i>Order</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The matters of course are; first, Swearing, and admitting
Officers; secondly, Debating about the <i>Knights-Companions</i>
then absent, and either dispensing with, or inflicting
Penalties on them; and thirdly, Constituting or
appointing an Officer, to carry on the State and Solemnity
of the Feast in the Sovereign’s absence. But other
Particulars that are occasional, cannot so well be brought
within Rule, as being wholly accidental.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the first, the Officers of the <i>Order</i>, soon after the
<i>Chapter</i> is open’d, take their respective Oaths, in Order
to perform the Duty of their several Places, during the
Session of the <i>Chapter</i>, and thenceforward, as is evident
from several Examples, but one may suffice, from a <i>Chapter</i>
held at <i>Windsor</i>, <i>Anno</i> 4 <i>Car.</i> I. whereat Dr. <i>Neal</i>, Bishop
of <i>Winchester</i>, was Sworn Prelate; Sir <i>Francis Crane</i>,
Chancellor; and Dr. <i>Mathew Wren</i>, Bishop of <i>Ely</i>, Register.</p>

<p class='c000'>It hath sometimes happened, that some of the Officers
of this <i>Order</i> have been Sworn at other Times, as at
<i>Chapters</i> next ensuing their Nomination and Choice, wherein
the Administration of the Oath is one of the first things
done.</p>

<p class='c000'>Touching the second particular debated in <i>Chapter</i>, <i>viz.</i>
the dispensing with, or punishing absent Knights; it is to
be considered, that the <i>Statutes</i> of the <i>Order</i> enjoin all
the <i>Knights-Companions</i> to be present at the Celebration
of the Grand Feast: that is, those that are within the
Kingdom, or elsewhere; although the Service of St. <i>George</i>,
according to the Rites of the Church, be not celebrated,
as on the Service of the Day whereon that of St. <i>George</i>
has fallen, <i>viz.</i> <i>Good-Friday</i>: But with this Limitation,
<span class='pageno' title='450' id='Page_450'></span><i>so that they be in a capacity, or may conveniently repair
thither</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Therefore the next thing usually entred upon in the
<i>Chapter</i>, is the Sovereign’s and <i>Knights-Companions</i> taking
notice, whether any of the Fellowship make default
of coming at the Hour assign’d; and if so, they are
considered under one of these Heads. First, Stranger
Princes; Secondly, Late Commissioners who are arrived,
or every Minute expected; and Thirdly, Such as have
given notice that they cannot be present, during the continuation
of the Feast: Of these Excuses of course, verbal
Apologies, or Letters of Excuse, are, or may be, offered;
and in case they are approved or admitted, then
the Penance, which by the <i>Statutes</i> ought otherwise to
be inflicted, is admitted; all which ought to be recorded.</p>

<p class='c000'>Stranger Princes are excused in course, on Account of
their necessary Residence in their own Territories; and
of their Excuses and accustom’d Dispensations, are divers
Instances in the Registers of the <i>Order</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to <i>Knights-Companions</i>, who are tardy in their Journey,
or being come to the Castle, fall short of the Hour,
or of attending the Sovereign to the <i>Chapter-House</i>, either
through negligence, or want of timely notice, or other
accident; the <i>Statutes</i> enjoin for Penance, that they be
not permitted for that time to enter into the <i>Chapter</i>, but
tarry without the Door, and not have Voice in any thing
that shall happen to be done there, unless they can alledge
a just Excuse, or render such a sufficient cause as the Sovereign,
or his Deputy, shall approve of; but few defaulters
have been noted of this kind.</p>

<p class='c000'>The third sort of Delinquents, are those <i>Knights-Companions</i>
absent, not only at the Hour of <i>Tierce</i>, but are
likely to be so during the whole Feast; the Proceedings
relating to them, are either upon what is offered in Excuse
of their absence, or determined on their neglect of making
Apology for it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Excuses for absence, are either by Letters or Word of
Mouth; if by Letters, they are directed to the Chancellor
of the <i>Order</i>; or else the Sovereign sends to his Lieutenant
on their behalf, and both are produc’d by the Chancellor:
But if Excuse be made by Word of Mouth, then
are they delivered by the Sovereign himself; or on motion
<span class='pageno' title='451' id='Page_451'></span>made by some of the <i>Knights-Companions</i> present in
<i>Chapter</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Custom of sending Letters has been very ancient:
The Lord <i>Powis</i>’s Letter, under his Hand and Seal, (certifying
his Indisposition of Body,) was produc’d in <i>Chapter</i>,
<i>Anno</i> 8 <i>Hen.</i> V. And the following Year the Dukes
of <i>York</i>, <i>Norfolk</i>, and <i>Buckingham</i>, with the Earls of <i>Salisbury</i>,
<i>Shrewsbury</i>, and <i>Pembrook</i>, Viscount <i>Bourchier</i>, the
Lord <i>Rivers</i>, and Sir <i>John Falstaff</i>; being all absent from
St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Feast</i>, <i>they declared the reason of their absence
by their Messengers</i>. There are many Precedents of this
kind, and of Letters sent from the Sovereign, directed to
his Lieutenant, to accept of <i>Knights-Companions</i> Excuses,
whose absence he had beforehand dispenc’d with; we observe
those Dispensations excus’d not the sending their
own particular Excuses; for it is evident they were also
expected, and that such allowance of absence was not
Absolute, the Clause running thus: <i>That you [the Sovereign’s
Deputy] allow these Excuses so far as are consonant
to reason</i>. And in all other Letters of the same nature, a
Clause to this Effect hath been inferred: <i>That as the Sovereign
thought good to advertise his Deputy, that for certain
Causes he had dispenc’d with their Attendance for that
time; so he will’d him to accept their reasonable Excuses in
that behalf accordingly</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Secondly, The absent <i>Knights-Companions</i> have had
their Excuses frequently made by Word of Mouth, either
of the Sovereign, or some other of the <i>Knights-Companions</i>,
present in the <i>Chapter</i>. This Favour is done either
by the Sovereign himself, if present; or by his Order
to the Lieutenant, in his absence.</p>

<p class='c000'>There have been many Examples of what hath been
done in this Case, and also when the Sovereign hath not
been present in <i>Chapter</i>, but hath beforehand verbally
given his Deputy or Lieutenant direction to excuse the
absence of several <i>Knights-Companions</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will be necessary to observe what Effect the Excuses
have usually produc’d; whereinto we find the just
and reasonable favourably admitted, some suspended,
and divers disallowed. Those easily allow’d were, first,
Sickness; (for those of the <i>Knights-Companions</i> who have
been either Sick, far spent with Age, or intent on publick
Affairs, have been readily allow’d,) Secondly, The not
<span class='pageno' title='452' id='Page_452'></span>recovery of Wounds receiv’d in the publick Service;
as we meet with in the Case of Sir <i>William Harington</i>,
<i>Anno</i> 7 <i>Hen.</i> V. whom we see excus’d <i>for his Illness, occasion’d
from his Wounds then lately receiv’d at the Siege of</i>
Rohan, <i>and elsewhere</i>. Thirdly, Impotency and old Age.
Fourthly, Imployment in the Sovereign’s Service, either
Abroad or at Home; those Abroad are necessarily excus’d,
those at Home we shall be more particular to. The Earl
of <i>Shrewsbury</i>, <i>Anno</i> 22 <i>Eliz.</i> was taken up in certain Affairs,
enjoin’d him by the Sovereign; the Earl of <i>Huntington</i>,
26 <i>Eliz.</i> being President of the Council of the
North, his absence was for that, and several Years following,
favourably excus’d; and a like Case was that of
the Earl of <i>Danby</i>, <i>Anno</i> 13 <i>Car.</i> I. who for his necessary
Attendance at the Seat of Justice in <i>Eyre</i>, was excus’d
waiting on the Sovereign at the Grand Feast that Year.
Fifthly, <i>When the Grand Feast hath receiv’d Prorogation,
and any of the</i> Knights-Companions <i>have not had notice of
the Day whereunto it was prorogued</i>. Sixthly, <i>When any of
them have been in Captivity</i>; as was <i>Thomas</i>, Earl of
<i>Salisbury</i>, and the Earl of <i>Huntington</i>, both Prisoners in
<i>France</i>, <i>Anno</i> 2 <i>Hen.</i> VI. Seventhly, When any of them
have obtain’d the Sovereign’s Letters of Dispensation, of
which sufficient is spoken before. Lastly, <i>Some other just
and lawful Occasion</i>, as well as Accident, having fallen out;
(not relating to those under the former Heads,) the Sovereign,
on Information given in <i>Chapter</i>, hath been pleas’d
to allow of; as in the Case of the Lord <i>Fauconbridge</i>,
<i>Anno</i> 32 <i>Hen.</i> VI. was readily admitted, on his pleading
<i>the care of his Domestick Affairs, he having been lately in
Prison, and had obtained leave to go and see his House and
Lands in the Country</i>. The Earl of <i>Arundel</i>’s absence,
<i>Anno</i> 15 <i>Car.</i> I. was pardon’d, by reason of the Dutchess
of <i>Richmond</i>’s Death, who died on the Eve of the Grand
Feast; that so he (being the chief of her Family,) might
be at Hand to advise and assist in all things conducing to
the Honour of the deceased Dutchess.</p>

<p class='c000'>And as the <i>Knights-Companions</i> have been often excus’d
for not appearing on the Grand Feast, so hath the
Sovereign, on sufficient Grounds, been pleas’d to license
and dispence with their departure; from the same of this
is an Example, 6 <i>Eliz.</i> when the Lord <i>Hastings</i> of <i>Loughborough</i>,
falling Ill a little before the Offering on St.
<span class='pageno' title='453' id='Page_453'></span><i>George</i>’s <i>Day</i>, obtain’d Licence from the Sovereign to depart
out of the <i>Choir</i>; and came no more abroad that Day,
nor during the Feast. As also another in the Duke of
<i>Lenox</i>, <i>Anno</i> 15 <i>Car.</i> I. <i>The Deputy Chancellor having, by
Command of the Sovereign, and in discharge of the Duty of
his Office</i>; who being forc’d to go back to <i>London</i>, by
reason of the aforesaid Dutchess of <i>Richmond</i>’s Death, had
his Excuse, and the Sovereign’s Licence for departure.</p>

<p class='c000'>We are next to consider Excuses, which, though sent in
due time, yet on Debate in <i>Chapter</i> were suspended rather
than allow’d; to which Head may be referr’d that
Case of several of the <i>Knights-Companions</i>, who were
Members of the Lord’s House in the long Parliament.
For <i>Anno</i> 18 <i>Car.</i> I. the Deputy Chancellor having, by
the Command of the Sovereign, and in discharge of the
Duty of his Office, sent to each of them a Summons,
for their Attendance at the Celebration of the Grand
Feast, to be held for the preceeding Year at <i>York</i>; and
notice thereof being given to the House of Lords, they
immediately made the ensuing Order.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>Die Martis 22 Maii, 1641.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><i>Whereas the Lord Chamberlain of his Majesty’s Houshould,
and some other Lords of Parliament, Knights of the</i> Garter,
<i>have been Summoned to give their Attendance, and repair
into the City of</i> York, <i>for the Celebration of St.</i> George’<i>s
Feast; who acquainting this House with the Summons aforesaid,
it is this Day ordered by the Lords in Parliament, that
they attend the weighty Affairs of the Kingdom discussed in
Parliament, whereunto they are obliged by his Majesty’s
Writ, and the Law of the Land.</i></p>

<div class='c025'>Jo. Browne, Cleric. Parliament.</div>

<p class='c008'>Whereupon the said <i>Knights-Companions</i>, before the Days
appointed by Prorogation for holding the Feast, sent their
petitionary Letters of Excuse to the Deputy Chancellor,
wherein they profess’d their desire and readiness to attend,
in Obedience of the said Summons; nevertheless
pleaded the foresaid <i>Order</i> for the Ground of their stay in
<i>London</i>, and therefore desired him to obtain for them the
Sovereign’s Dispensation: On producing the said Letters
in <i>Chapter</i>, the Sovereign would not at that time either admit
<span class='pageno' title='454' id='Page_454'></span>or disallow of their Excuses, but referr’d the consideration
to the next <i>Chapter</i>, to be held by Prorogation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of Excuses which have not been allow’d, the most remarkable
is that of the Duke of <i>Norfolk</i>, and the Lord
<i>Scales</i>, <i>Anno</i> 36 <i>Hen.</i> VI. who were adjudg’d to the Penalty
of the Statute, in regard the Causes alledged to excuse
their absence were not approved; the latter was
signed by the Sovereign and <i>Knights-Companions</i>, in a
Jewel to the value of twenty Marks, to be offered in the
College; whereby the rigour of the <i>Statutes</i> appears to
have been more strictly executed on him, than the Duke,
probably because the Lord <i>Scales</i> was absent the Year
before, and no cause thereof shewed to the <i>Chapter</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In relation to the Proceedings on the absent <i>Knights-Companions</i>
neglect of sending their Excuses, we shall observe,
that some of them have with difficulty been remitted,
some left in suspence, and others sentenc’d, and referr’d
either to the Sovereign’s pleasure, or the Punishment
assign’d by Law; of the first kind we find that the
Earl of <i>Westmorland</i>, <i>Anno</i> 10 <i>Hen.</i> V. though not very
well, yet had much ado to be excus’d, because he signified
not the Cause of his absence, as the <i>Statutes</i> required.
So <i>Anno</i> 12 <i>Car.</i> I. the Earls of <i>Derby</i> and <i>Kelly</i>,
having made no Excuse, were for that Omission blameable,
but by the Grace of the Sovereign for that time pardon’d.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to those who, through the indulgence of the Sovereign,
(where probable cause hath induc’d it,) have not
had Sentence pass’d on them presently, but were deferr’d
in expectation of some satisfactory Cause to be shewed;
we find in the Case of the Prince, the Duke of <i>Buckingham</i>,
and five other <i>Knights-Companions</i> absent from the Feast,
held <i>Anno</i> 18 <i>Hen.</i> VII. wherein it is registred, that <i>no
cause of Excuse was shewed, but there was an expectation
of one to be alledged</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>But as for those of the third sort, on whom Sentence
hath pass’d; they have been left either to the pleasure
of the Sovereign, or to those Penalties which the Law of
this <i>Order</i> inflict; of which, as also of those on whom
Judgment hath pass’d, are divers Instances.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides these Grounds of assigning Penances, there are
other Causes set down in the before recited ninth Article,
of the <i>Statutes</i> of Institution for Penances; as when the
<i>Knights Companions</i> are absent at other times, beside the
<span class='pageno' title='455' id='Page_455'></span>Hour of <i>Tierce</i>, that is, the beginning of the first <i>Vespers</i>.
Secondly, At the beginning of the Morning Service on the
Feast Day. Thirdly, At the beginning of the second <i>Vespers</i>.
Fourthly, During the whole Feast. And, Fifthly,
at the Grand Feast next following.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the first, admitting any <i>Knight-Companion</i> hath failed
of meeting and attending on the Sovereign at the Hour
of <i>Tierce</i>, and thereupon suffered the Punishment of Non-admittance
into the <i>Chapter-House</i>, and deprivation of
Vote; nevertheless if at the rising of the said <i>Chapter</i>,
he be not ready to proceed with the Sovereign, and
other the <i>Knights-Companions</i>, into the <i>Choir</i>, to the beginning
of the first <i>Vespers</i>; he ought not only to suffer
the former, but this additional Penalty, that he shall not
presume to Enter into his Stall at that time, but tarry in
that part of the <i>Choir</i>, where the Taper-bearers are wont
to stand; nevertheless before his own Stall, until the holy
Offices be ended; and the Law of the <i>Order</i> is the same
in King <i>Henry</i> V’s, and King <i>Henry</i> VIII’s <i>Statutes</i>, only
render the Place for the Delinquent Knight to stand in, to
be before the Stalls in the Choiristers Places; and now
how the Penalty hath been inflicted, upon breach of the
Law in this particular, we shall see by the following
Instances.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the Grand Feast celebrated at <i>Windsor</i>, <i>An.</i> 21 <i>H.</i> VII.
when it seems the Lord <i>Kildare</i>, Sir <i>Gilbert Talbot</i>, and
Sir <i>Richard Goulford</i>, came late to the Chappel, we find
this Memorandum fixt to their Names; they stood without,
(before their Stalls) by the Sovereign’s Permission, or
rather Command: But yet this is not all the Punishment
which hath been inflicted upon the <i>Knights-Companions</i> for
this Offence; (though it be all that is set down in the
foresaid Article,) for <i>Anno</i> 25 <i>Hen.</i> VI. upon the Eve of
St. <i>George</i>, the Marquiss of <i>Dorset</i> not coming to the first
<i>Vespers</i>, and being convicted of his late coming, was prohibited
joining in the Nomination then made, for the
Election of the King of <i>Portugal</i>, into the room of the
Duke of <i>Gloucester</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Offenders in the second and third Case, being such as
neglect to come before the beginning of the high Mass, or
the second <i>Vespers</i>, called also the <i>Vespers</i> on St. <i>George</i>’s
<i>Day</i>, have the like Punishment with the former assigned
them, throughout all the Bodies of the <i>Statutes</i>; <i>viz.</i>
<span class='pageno' title='456' id='Page_456'></span>Exclusion from their Stalls, and Station in the Choiristers
Range.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Anno</i> 1 <i>Hen.</i> VI. We observe the Lord <i>Willoughby</i> noted
to be absent upon the Eve of the Grand Feast, but
present on the Day; and consequently he incurred no
further Penance than what his absence on the Eve drew
on him; the Earl of <i>Derby</i>, <i>Anno</i> 18 <i>Eliz.</i> coming too late
to the first Morning Service on the Feast Day, did for
some short time undergo the same Penance, but soon after,
upon Dispensation from the Lieutenant, went up to
his Stall.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are several other Instances; and besides the aforesaid
Defaults, he is likewise to undergo the same Penalties,
when the Grand Feast is prorogued, or celebrated at any
other Place than <i>Windsor</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>But if he offend in all, and have no reasonable or allowable
Excuse for his absence, he is then prohibited entering
his Stall at the next Feast, and to pay ten Pounds,
to be employed towards the Ornaments of the College;
and sometimes the former Penance has been inflicted for
late coming to Divine Service.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fourth degree of Offence is yet greater than any,
and the variety of Penances are heightened. If a <i>Knight-Companion</i>
shall neglect coming to the Grand Feast, and
have no allowable reason; he shall not at the Feast held
the ensuing Year be permitted to enter his own Stall,
but stand below it; he shall walk alone by himself before
three Crosses, which, in ancient time, were born in
the Grand Procession: When the Grand Procession returns
to the <i>Choir</i>, he shall stand in the Place aforesaid,
till the time of the Offertory; he shall Offer last by himself,
and then humbly approach the Stall of the Sovereign,
or his Deputy, and there desire Absolution. But
there is no Instance that these Rigours were put in Execution,
though many have offended in this kind.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lastly, The <i>Statutes</i> enjoin; That where a <i>Knight-Companion</i>
remains within the Kingdom, and shall be
Guilty of an Omission two Years together, he ought to
be so long interdicted his Stall, till he have offered a
Jewel at St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Altar</i>, to the Value of twenty Marks;
and thenceforward every Year in which he shall be guilty
of the same Omission, the Penalty to be doubled, till he
is pardoned: The most memorable Case in the Prosecution
<span class='pageno' title='457' id='Page_457'></span>of a Contempt, was against the Earl of <i>Arundel</i>,
14 <i>Edw.</i> IV. who for being absent two Years together,
was Mulct forty Marks; and continuing his Contempt
the next Year, was fined the Sum of eighty Marks.</p>

<p class='c000'>Touching the Necessity, and Power, of the Sovereign’s
constituting a Deputy; it was provided for at the Institution
of the <i>Order</i>; the Sovereign being then engaged in
the Wars of <i>France</i>, thought it reasonable that Provision
should be made by the <i>Statutes</i>, for to depute some Person
in his stead.</p>

<p class='c000'>When therefore such Occasion happened, a Commission
was made out to one of the <i>Knights-Companions</i>, some
reasonable time before the approach of the Feast; so that
none of the ancient Ceremonies might be omitted, or any
Impediment happen through his absence; and such Deputy
hath usually been one of the chief of the <i>Order</i>, in
Authority, Eminence, or Birth. The first so made was,
<i>John</i> Duke of <i>Bedford</i>, 7 <i>Hen.</i> V. and the reason thereof
given, in the <i>Registrum Chartaceum</i>, is, because the
Sovereign was then employed in the Wars in <i>Normandy</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>And though the Title given by the <i>Statutes</i> to this
Officer, be not particularly mentioned in the <i>Blue-Book</i>,
where it speaks of the said Duke’s holding the Feast of
St. <i>George</i> that Year, but rather implied in the Words
<i>Regiæ Sublimatis locum implevit</i>; yet in the <i>Registrum
Chartaceum</i> it is expresly set down, and the said Duke
there styled, <i>Depute de l’Ordre de Jaritiere</i>. Sometimes
he has been styled, <i>Deputatis Ordinis, &amp; præses clarissimæ
Ordinis</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'>About the beginning of the Reign of King <i>Henry</i> VIII.
the Title of <i>Locum Tenens</i>, or Lieutenant, began to be
taken up, and has, for the most part, continued in all succeeding
Times; and the other Titles of Deputy, President,
and Vicegerent, laid aside. As to the Business of
this Officer, sufficient has been said already. As an Essential
Honour to his Place, he has from ancient Time
had some of the <i>Knights-Companions</i> assigned for his Assistants;
the first mention of which is in the <i>Registrum
Chartaceum</i>, 8 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. The Number of these Assistants
were in those times uncertain; at the time aforesaid
they were 4. 21 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. 3. and 32 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. we find
but two; which Number has been a constant Rule ever
since, except once, <i>viz.</i> the last of <i>Hen.</i> VIII. They were
always appointed in <i>Chapter</i>, and have Letters of notice
<span class='pageno' title='458' id='Page_458'></span>sent them thereof: But neither the Lieutenant, nor Assistants,
can be Chosen two Years together, except the
Sovereign should please to be present at the Day or Feast;
and after it was Decreed, 23 and 24 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. that
this Indulgence should extend to the term of three Years.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lastly, We observe that this Officer always held the
Feast at his peculiar Cost and Charge; and gave liberal
Rewards to <i>Garter</i>, and for his Escutcheons, as also to the
Officers of Arms, Gentlemen-Ushers, Alms-Knights, and
to all the several Waiters and Attendants employed in the
Ceremony.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>The Ceremonies relating to the first</i> Vespers.</h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 6. The first <i>Chapter</i> held on the Eve of St. <i>George</i>
being finished, the Sovereign and <i>Knights-Companions</i>
immediately proceed from the <i>Chapter-House</i> to the <i>Choir</i>,
to hear <i>Vespers</i>. The Officers of Arms, Prebends, and
Alms-Knights, having attended in the North-Isle of the
Chappel, do now put themselves in Rank, and continue
the Proceeding from the <i>Chapter-House</i> Door, along the
said North-Isle, to the West Door of the <i>Choir</i>; in like
manner as they did from the Presence Chamber, to the
<i>Chapter-House</i>: The Organs then beginning to play, and
so continue till <i>Vespers</i> begin.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Alms-Knights arrive at the West-Door, they
first enter in a whole Body, while the rest of the Proceeding
makes a short stand, and pass forward near the
middle of the <i>Choir</i>, where they make a joint and low
Obeysance; next, all turning about by the left Hand,
to the Sovereign’s Seat; then still turning from the right,
to the left Hand, they ascend the <i>Haut Pas’s</i>, even to
the Rails set before the <i>Altar</i>; and forthwith divide themselves,
flanking on each side, the <i>Juniors</i> nearest the Rails.</p>

<p class='c000'>This done, the Prebends enter in a Body also, and
having made the like Obeysances in the middle of the
<i>Choir</i>, divide themselves, and take their Seats; which, by
King <i>Henry</i> VIII’s <i>Statutes</i>, are appointed in the lower
range of Seats, between, but not in, the Stalls of the
<i>Knights-Companions</i>. While the Prebends are entering
their Seats, the Pursuivants, Heralds, and Provincial
Kings of Arms, in a Body, likewise enter the <i>Choir</i>;
<span class='pageno' title='459' id='Page_459'></span>and after due Reverence, pass up to the <i>Altar</i>, and join
the Alms-Knights; though anciently some difference was
in this Ceremony.</p>

<p class='c000'>Afterwards, the two <i>Junior Knights-Companions</i> enter,
passing on till they come near their own Stalls, and
there make their Reverences, and then divide, and take
their stands directly before their Stalls; and so of the
rest of the <i>Knights-Companions</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next to the <i>Knights-Companions</i>, the <i>Black-Rod</i>, <i>Garter</i>,
and <i>Register</i>, enter in a Breast, who, proceeding to the
middle of the <i>Choir</i>, make their Obeysances, and then
pass to their Form, placed on the South-side of the <i>Choir</i>,
before the Sovereign’s Stall, and stand before it. After
them, the Chancellor and Prelate in the like manner,
stand before their Form, placed near the Sovereign’s Seat:
And for these Forms, whereon the Officers of the <i>Order</i>
sit in the Chappel, there is a special Decree for the allowance
of them, entered at the end of the Constitutions of
their Offices.</p>

<p class='c000'>Last of all the Sovereign enters, (having the Sword born
before him, but his Band of Pensioners stay at the <i>Choir</i>
Door, to keep off the Crowd,) who, coming to the Steps
which ascend the Royal Seat, makes a Reverence toward
the Altar, and then takes Place therein, before he makes
a second Reverence.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Lieutenant, in the Sovereign’s absence, proceeds
to the first <i>Vespers</i>; as soon as he enters the <i>Choir</i>,
and comes near the Sovereign’s Stall, he stands and makes
a little pause there; then doing his Reverences, after he
has again stood a while, before he ascends his own;
where being arrived, he makes the double Reverence a
second time, and then sits down.</p>

<p class='c000'>And now to placing the <i>Knights-Companions</i> in their
Stalls: <i>Garter</i>, as soon as the Sovereign, or his Lieutenant,
is placed, makes again the usual Reverence in the
middle of the <i>Choir</i>; then turns to the <i>Senior</i> Knights, and
doth his Reverence to each of them; whereupon, at one
Instant, they make their double Reverences below, where
they stood, and strait ascend at the first, or western Entrance,
that goes to the side Stalls; where being arrived,
they make again their double Reverences, and then seat
themselves. But when the Sovereign’s Lieutenant is present,
each Knight adds a third Reverence to him, both
<span class='pageno' title='460' id='Page_460'></span>when they ascend to, and descend from, their Stalls; and
so likewise do all Persons, who pass in the Proceeding, add
to their double Reverences so often as there is occasion to
make it, after such time as the Lieutenant is entered his
Stall; and so long as he continues therein, both on the
Eve, the Feast Day, and the Morrow after.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>Knights-Companions</i> being all seated, the Prelate
and Chancellor pass into the middle of the <i>Choir</i>, and
having made double Reverences, return to their Forms,
and sit down. And after them, in the same manner, the
<i>Register</i>, <i>Garter</i>, and <i>Black-Rod</i>, proceed.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the Sovereign’s other Attendants, the Nobleman
who carries the Sword retires before the Sovereign’s
Stall, a little on the right Hand; and the Lord Chamberlain
of the Houshold, if not a Knight of the <i>Garter</i>, and
the Vice Chamberlain, on the left, till the Sovereign give
them leave to sit down. The Clerk of the Closet stands
at the Sovereign’s right Hand, but the young Noblemen,
that carry up the Sovereign, and the Gentleman of the
Robes, sometimes repose themselves on the Steps going to
the Sovereign’s Stall.</p>

<p class='c000'>This being done, preparation for <i>Vespers</i> begin; in reference
to which, the Prelate ascends the <i>Altar</i>, it being
the Duty of his Office, which if he omits, he is fined twenty
Marks, to the use of the College, unless he give sufficient
reason for his absence; in which Case, or on the vacancy
of the See of <i>Winchester</i>, the Sovereign hath sometimes
appointed another Bishop to Officiate for him. The Proceeding
to the <i>Altar</i>, on this occasion, is as follows.</p>

<p class='c000'>First, The Serjeant of the Vestry makes a double Reverence,
then comes before the Prelate, and makes a single
one to him; who thereon arises from his Seat, and the
Serjeant proceeds before him into the middle of the <i>Choir</i>,
where the Prelate makes a double Reverence; and passing
forward after the Serjeant, and having ascended the uppermost
<i>Haut-pas</i> before the <i>Altar</i>, he makes one single Reverence
toward the same, and so goes to the North side
of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>After which, the two <i>Provincial Kings</i>, <i>Heralds</i>, and
<i>Pursuivants</i>, leaving their fore-mentioned Stations, join
together till they come near the Forms of the <i>Register</i>,
<i>Garter</i>, and <i>Black-Rod</i>; where, making their double Reverences,
<span class='pageno' title='461' id='Page_461'></span>they divide again on each side, and there
stand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lastly, The Alms-Knights come down into the <i>Choir</i> in
a Body, and there make their joint double Reverences,
and then take their Chairs; all which being finished,
Divine Service is begun by the Prelate.</p>

<p class='c000'>The like Solemnity is observed at any other Place, as
well as at <i>Windsor</i>; where, because the Alms-Knights are
absent, the Pursuivants at Arms ascend nearer the <i>High-Altar</i>
than when they are at <i>Windsor</i>; but this occasions
little Variation.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the <i>Vespers</i> are ended, the Prelate goes to the
middle of the <i>Altar</i>, and with great Reverence makes an
Obeysance; and thence, with the Serjeant before him,
descends to the middle of the <i>Choir</i>, where he makes his
double Reverences, and so returns to his Seat; whereupon
all make ready to pass out of the <i>Choir</i>, which is
performed in much the same manner, and with the same
State, as they proceeded thither; and the Servants and
Attendants of the <i>Knights-Companions</i> are marshalled in
the same Order as they were at the beginning of the
Proceeding, that the whole Procession may again pass
through them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Alms-Knights having entered the Guard Chamber,
spread themselves on each side thereof; the Prebends pass
through them, and fall off on either side the Room to
the Presence Chamber Door.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the <i>Pursuivants</i>, <i>Heralds</i>, and <i>Provincial Kings</i>,
proceeding through the Lane made by the Alms-Knights
and Prebends, enter the Presence Chamber, and fall off on
either side toward the Stall, the King’s standing uppermost.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then enter the <i>Knights-Companions</i>, and place themselves
on each side of the State, in such Order as they sat
in their Stalls, the eldest nearest the State; but those
whose Companions are absent, stand alone; after whom
follow the Officers of the <i>Order</i>, disposing themselves conveniently
near the State.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lastly, The Sovereign passes to the Step before the
State, where, being arrived, he turns toward the <i>Knights-Companions</i>,
who make their Reverences jointly to him,
and he thereon puts off his Cap, and re-salutes them;
<span class='pageno' title='462' id='Page_462'></span>which done, the Sovereign and they withdraw into the
Privy Chamber till Supper time.</p>

<p class='c000'>But in Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>’s Reign, when the Feast of St.
<i>George</i> was held at <i>White-Hall</i>, or <i>Greenwich</i>, and the
Sovereign, as was usual with her, proceeded no farther
on the Eve to <i>Vespers</i>, than to the great Closet, the ordinary
way, and thence sent her Lieutenant into the <i>Choir</i>.
Then, in such Case, when <i>Vespers</i> were ended, the Lieutenant
returned from the <i>Choir</i>, through the great Hall,
and so back to the said Closet, and stood at the Door
thereof, attending the Sovereign’s coming forth; from
whence they all proceeded before her into the Presence-Chamber,
and there the Ceremony, for that time, ended.</p>

<p class='c000'>But in the Reign of King <i>James</i> I. when the Supper on
the Eve, as also the following Meals, were prepared in
the Banquetting-House, the Sovereign’s Lieutenant frequently
returned from the Closet, by the Lobby, to the
said Banquetting-House, instead of going to the Presence;
and passing up the State, gave an End to the Ceremony
till Supper time: And so we find it observed in
the 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, and 16 of that King.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Sovereign and <i>Knights-Companions</i> are retired,
they are not to put off any part of their Robes till Supper
is over, for that is prohibited by the <i>Statutes</i>, not only
to those who do not Sup, as well as those who do. And
hereon, 19 <i>Car.</i> II. the Sovereign having a mind to take
the Air, went into <i>Hide-Park</i>, after he had taken leave of
the <i>Knights-Companions</i>, the Dukes of <i>York</i> and <i>Monmouth</i>,
and the Earl of <i>Oxford</i> being with him, but all in full
Robes, and so returned to Supper.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>The Supper on the Eve.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 7. When the Sovereign is pleased to Sup publickly,
on the Eve of the Feast at <i>Windsor</i>, the Supper has been
always prepared in St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Hall</i>. The usual Place at
<i>White-Hall</i>, was heretofore in the Presence Chamber; of
later times, the Banquetting-House; and at <i>Greenwich</i>,
either the Presence, or the Council Chamber; where the
Sovereign, or his Lieutenant, were always present. But
when the Feast of St. <i>George</i> was celebrated at <i>York</i>,
17 <i>Car.</i> I. the Sovereign and <i>Knights-Companions</i> marched
<span class='pageno' title='463' id='Page_463'></span>after the first <i>Vespers</i>, to a House prepared for that purpose,
and supped there.</p>

<p class='c000'>But if the Eve of the Feast fell out on a Fasting Day,
as it did 22 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. and 11 <i>Jac.</i> I. the Supper was always
omitted; and the Sovereign, with his Lieutenant,
and <i>Knights-Companions</i>, were served of the Void only.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor does the Sovereign, when he Sups publickly, pass
privately to the Place; but as soon as notice is given
that the first Mess is set upon the Table, he presently enters
the Presence Chamber, whence the Officers of the
<i>Order</i>, and of Arms, the <i>Knights-Companions</i> in their full
Robes, for so the <i>Statutes</i> expresly direct, having put themselves
into their usual Order, proceed before him to St.
<i>George</i>’s-<i>Hall</i>: Where being entered, the <i>Pursuivants</i>,
<i>Heralds</i>, and <i>Provincial Kings</i>, fall off all upon the right
Hand, opposite to the <i>Knights-Companions</i> Table, the <i>Junior
Pursuivants</i> standing toward the lower End of the Hall.
Then the <i>Knights-Companions</i> passing up beyond them,
formerly divided themselves on either side, according to
the Decree, 16 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. and made a stand, each taking
Place, according to the Order of their Stalls. But at the
Feast held at <i>White-Hall</i>, 19 <i>Car.</i> II. the Sovereign directed
that they should stand all on the right Hand side,
facing the Table.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next, the five Officers of the <i>Order</i> follow, who ascending
beyond the <i>Senior</i> Knight, retire on the right
Hand: After them the Sovereign, and the Officers of Arms,
all doing him Reverence as he passes by: Who passing up
to the <i>Haut-pas</i>, before his own Table, turns himself to
the <i>Knights-Companions</i>, and putting off his Cap, they return
their Reverences jointly to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sovereign sitting down to Supper, is first served
by Water by some Nobleman; then Grace is said by the
Prelate; then is the <i>Senior</i> Knight conducted to his Table
by two Officers of <i>Arms</i>, and so the rest in Order, to the
Tables appointed them. Whereupon the Officers of the
<i>Order</i>, and of Arms, retire out of the Hall to Supper.</p>

<p class='c000'>If a Lieutenant be constituted, he proceeds to Supper
in full Robes, and in the same Order as doth the Sovereign,
and sits alone at the Sovereign’s Table, yet on the
left Hand of the Cloth of State, being served in all Points
with Water, and by a <i>Cup-bearer</i>, <i>Carver</i>, and <i>Sewer</i>, as
the Sovereign himself is.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='464' id='Page_464'></span>When Supper is ended, and the Banquet taken away,
the Sovereign and <i>Knights-Companions</i> proceed back in the
same Order they came to the Presence Chamber, where
the Sovereign, or his Lieutenant, standing on the Step
before the Cloth of State, Salutes them as before; and
then appoints the Hour and Place for the <i>Knights-Companions</i>
to attend him the next Morning: The like, if the
Supper be provided in any other Place besides the Presence
Chamber, the Sovereign and <i>Knights-Companions</i> proceed
back thither, because the Ceremony ought to end there,
as has always been the Custom. And if the Supper be
prepared in the Presence Chamber, they then take their
Leave in the same Room, there being no occasion to proceed
farther.</p>

<p class='c000'>If any of the <i>Knights-Companions</i> accompany the Sovereign,
or his Lieutenant, to his Lodgings, they then go
after, not before him, in regard the State of that Night’s
Service ended in the Presence Chamber; and after they
have retired to their Lodging, they have Permission to
Unrobe.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Sovereign, or his Lieutenant, do not Sup in
St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Hall</i> on the Eve of the Feast, on the following
Night, the Officers of Arms have formerly had the
Liberty to Eat there; and this Privilege was assigned
them by Decree of a <i>Chapter</i> held 16 <i>Eliz.</i> appointing
them <i>that Table, which was before that time used by the
Chancellor, Register</i>, and other <i>Officers</i> of the <i>Order</i>: But
how they came to lose this Privilege, is not mentioned;
for now, instead of sitting in the great Hall, they are necessitated
to Eat in such Rooms of the Castle as they can
procure.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='465' id='Page_465'></span>
  <h2 id='ch21' class='c005'>CAP. XXI.<br /> <br /><i>The Order of the Ceremonies on the Feast Day.</i></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'><i>The Proceeding to the Chappel in the Morning.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 1.</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c009'>Notwithstanding
the Celebration of the Feast
takes up three Days, <i>viz.</i> part of the twenty
second, all the twenty third, and part of the
twenty fourth of <i>April</i>, yet the twenty third, St. <i>George</i>’s
<i>Day</i>, is the Grand Part: The Ceremonies of which may
be divided into Sacred and Civil, the first solemnized in
the Chappel, the latter in St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Hall</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Order to which, <i>the Knights-Companions</i> in full Robes
repair to the Sovereign’s Privy Lodgings, at the Hour appointed;
as also the Officers of the <i>Order</i>. In the mean
time the rest of the Degrees and Persons, which made up
the Proceeding on the Eve of the Feast, take their several
Stations then appointed them, to attend the Sovereign’s
coming out of the Presence-Chamber.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Sovereign, having the <i>Knights-Companions</i>,
and Officers of the <i>Order</i> before him, has entered the Presence,
the Sword is delivered to the Nobleman appointed
to bear it; and after the usual Salutations, the Proceeding
sets forward to the Chappel in the same Order as on the
Eve; the <i>Knights-Companions</i> having their Trains born
by some of their own Gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the Foot of the Stairs, entering the Cloister, or
Stone Gallery, twelve Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber
attend, with a rich Canopy of Cloth of Gold, who, when
the Sovereign approaches, receive him under it, and bear
it over his Head, till he comes to the <i>Choir Door</i> of St.
<i>George</i>’s <i>Chappel</i>; which Canopy is carried only on the
Morning of the Feast Day, and not at any other time.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Processional way to the Chappel, is the same they
traversed on the Eve, if the Sovereign and <i>Knights-Companions</i>
proceed to the <i>Chapter-House</i> first; for anciently
<span class='pageno' title='466' id='Page_466'></span>it was the Custom to hold a <i>Chapter</i> in the Morning of the
Feast Day, either before Mattins, or after, before the
Grand Procession set forward. This Course received interruption
in Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>’s time, during which, no
Chapter was held in the Morning, except in the 26, 31,
and 38 Years of her Reign, and then only for admitting
some Officers of the <i>Order</i>: But the time of holding this
<i>Chapter</i> was restored by King <i>Charles</i> I. who several times
held it before the first Service began; as in the 5, 14,
and 15, of his Reign.</p>

<p class='c000'>But if no <i>Chapter</i> be held at this time, then, as soon as
the Proceeding comes near the Chappel, instead of entering
the Passage between the East-end of the Chappel, and
King <i>Henry</i> VIII’s Tomb House, as it does on the Eve,
by reason the Sovereign goes first to the <i>Chapter-House</i>, it
proceeds straight on to the South Door, and thence into
the <i>Choir</i>: Yet King <i>Charles</i> II. in the 15 of his Reign,
appointed the whole Proceeding to pass by the said South
Door, all along the South side of the Chappel, and then
to enter at the West Door, which was then, and since
observed.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Alms-Knights are come to the West Door
of the <i>Choir</i>, they enter, and pass up above the Steps of
the <i>Altar</i>, in the very same Manner and Order as they did
on the Eve, and so exactly of the rest: Which being done,
the Prelate begins the Morning Service, according to the
Order observed in the Common-Prayer, only that the
first Lesson being made proper to the Festival, is taken
out of the 44 Chapter of <i>Ecclesiasticus</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Solemn Proceeding to the Chappel in the Morning
of the Feast Day, is, and has been, most usual performed
on Foot; yet there are Instances heretofore, where
the Sovereign and <i>Knights-Companions</i> have proceeded
on Horse-back, for the greater Splendor and Gallantry of
the <i>Order</i>: As in 16 <i>Edw.</i> IV. when several Ladies rode
in the Cavalcade, richly adorned, of which Habit mention
is already made. So also 3 <i>Hen.</i> VII. when it was augmented
by the Presence of the Queen, and the King’s
Mother, attended by a splendid Train of Ladies: And
again the 22 of the same King, when he held the Feast at
<i>Baynard</i>’s-<i>Castle</i>, in <i>London</i>, he proceeded on Horse back
to St. <i>Paul</i>’s: The like King <i>Henry</i> VIII. did at <i>Windsor</i>,
on the Feast of St. <i>George</i>, 11 of his Reign; and King
<span class='pageno' title='467' id='Page_467'></span><i>Philip</i>, 1 and 2 of <i>Phil.</i> and <i>Mar.</i> and Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>,
in the 6 of her Reign, in her whole Habit of the <i>Order</i>;
so did the Sovereign’s Lieutenant at the same Feast ride
to the first and second <i>Vespers</i>, and to the Morning Service
the Day after.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a Custom begun by Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>, and used
when she celebrated St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Feast</i>, either at <i>White-Hall</i>,
or <i>Greenwich</i>, for the Sovereign’s Lieutenant, and
<i>Knights-Companions</i>, in full Robes, attended with the Officers
of the <i>Order</i>, and of <i>Arms</i>, to meet in the Presence
Chamber, about nine in the Morning of the Feast Day,
and proceed thence as they did the Evening before, through
the Guard Chamber, down into the great Hall, and thence
into the Chappel, where they took their Stalls, as on the
Eve; after which, Morning Prayer was performed as far
as the Litany, and this was called the first Service; which
done, they all descended from their Stalls, in the accustomed
Order, and proceeded back to the Presence, and
there waited the coming of the Sovereign, before whom
they proceeded a second time to the <i>Choir</i>, where the Litany,
and Grand Procession began, called the second Service,
at which the Sovereign was usually Present; but
seldom at the first Service.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first Instance we have met with of this double
Proceeding, is recorded in the <i>Blue-Book</i> of the <i>Order</i>,
3 <i>Eliz.</i> and was continued throughout her Reign; and
that of King <i>James</i> I. not only when the Feast of St.
<i>George</i> was celebrated at <i>White-Hall</i>, or <i>Greenwich</i>, but
also at other times, when celebrated at <i>Windsor</i>; and so
1 <i>Car.</i> I. But from that time, the Sovereign went to the
Chappel at the beginning of Morning Service, which was
continued without interruption: Which way has been
ever since duly observed.</p>

<p class='c000'>But when it was known that the Sovereign did not
go in the Grand Procession, but his Lieutenant for him;
then the Service was constantly gone through withal at
once.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>The Proceeding to the second Service.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 2. When the Feast has been celebrated elsewhere
than at <i>Windsor</i>, as soon as the Prelate was come
<span class='pageno' title='468' id='Page_468'></span>down from the <i>Altar</i>, on finishing the first Service, the
<i>Knights-Companions</i> descended from their Stalls in usual
Order; and then the Lieutenant, with the Officers of the
<i>Order</i>, and of <i>Arms</i>, proceeded before him to the Presence,
to conduct the Sovereign to the second Service;
which second Proceeding was disposed in the same manner
as was that to the first Service in the Morning; only
in the latter, because the Sovereign proceeded, the Sword
was also carried.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Of the Grand Procession.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 3. We are now arrived at the Grand Procession of
this most Noble <i>Order</i>, which is indeed the most Solemn,
and Magnificent Part of the whole Ceremony, and has
always been celebrated in the Morning of the Feast Day
of St. <i>George</i>; or on such other Day, as the Sovereign hath
appointed by Prorogation to hold the same. But as to
the instant of Time when it began, it has sometimes been
uncertain; with respect to the conveniency of the Church
Service, when it was conceived most proper; which was
generally at the end of the second Collect, and before
the Litany: Nevertheless, in 6 <i>Eliz.</i> the Feast being then
held at <i>Windsor</i>, it began presently after the <i>Te Deum</i>
was Sung; and the twentieth of the said Queen’s Reign,
at <i>Greenwich</i>, after reading the second Lesson. And to
come nearer our Times, the Grand Procession set forward,
8 <i>Car.</i> I. when the first Service was finished; and 17
<i>Car.</i> I. after the Sermon was ended: But at the Grand
Feast, 13 <i>Car.</i> II. it was brought to its usual time, after
the last Collect.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the Proceeding, or Processional way at <i>Windsor</i>,
that has not been always the same; sometimes it was
confined within the Walls of St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Chappel</i>, but at
other times enlarged through the lower Court of the
Castle; a few Instances of both Cases are remaining,
but none of any ancient date.</p>

<p class='c000'>What the Order and Manner of this Ceremony was,
may be collected from what an old Relator says, of the
Solemn Procession made the 29 <i>May</i>, 5 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. <i>That
it was ordered as of old Time accustomed</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='469' id='Page_469'></span>First went the Alms-Knights, two and two on either
side the <i>Choir</i>, then the Officers of Arms, next the
<i>Knights-Companions</i>; after them the Officers of the <i>Order</i>,
and then the Prelate bearing the Heart of St. <i>George</i>, under
a Canopy honourably assisted, four Noblemen bearing
each a Torch; and last of all the Sovereign.</p>

<p class='c000'>And though here is no mention of any Ecclesiasticks,
that joined themselves in the Proceeding; yet it cannot
be supposed, that as part of the Divine Service was to be
performed, but that some of the Chaplains and Priests
were included. And we meet with one Instance, where
the Priests not only went in the Grand Procession, but
had a Place assigned in it; where the Gentlemen of the
Sovereign’s <i>Chappel</i>, and <i>Choir</i> of <i>Windsor</i>, now go.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it must be confessed, that the Records of the <i>Order</i>
are very defective in this particular, relating to the Grand
Procession, and speak of it only in general, or at most,
take notice but of some of those Degrees that attend in
it; and this but of late Time neither: Among which,
23 <i>Eliz.</i> it is said; <i>They all proceeded in Order, as the Custom
was</i>; the Sovereign following in the Rear of the Procession.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to Place and Precedency, it is in every respect the
same, as in the Sovereign’s Proceeding to the Chappel, on
the Eve of the Grand Feast; only here are some Persons
added, which go not in that; Namely, the Gentlemen
and Choiristers of the Sovereign’s Chappel at <i>White-Hall</i>;
and the Petty-Canons, Vicars, and Choiristers of <i>Windsor</i>:
The whole Order is as follows.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Morning Service having proceeded to the second
Lesson, and the Prelate conducted by the Serjeant of the
Vestry from the <i>Altar</i> to his Seat;</p>

<p class='c000'>The Alms-Knights rise from their Seats, and pass to the
middle of the <i>Choir</i>; and after their accustomed Reverences,
go up to the sides of the <i>Altar</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next, in like manner, the Officers of Arms pass up.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hereupon <i>Garter</i> rises from his Seat, and makes his
usual Reverences; then waving his Rod, summons the
<i>Junior</i> Knights to descend.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whilst they and the rest of the <i>Knights-Companions</i> are
leaving their Stalls, with usual Reverences; the Gentlemen
of the Chappel, Petty-Canons, and Vicars of <i>Windsor</i>,
put on Copes, and make themselves ready to proceed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='470' id='Page_470'></span>Then the <i>Knights-Companions</i> being all come down,
stand each under his proper Stall.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the <i>Black-Rod</i>, <i>Garter</i>, and <i>Register</i> rise, and stand
before their Forms.</p>

<p class='c000'>So do the Chancellor and Prelate.</p>

<p class='c000'>This done, the Alms-Knights come down from the
<i>Altar</i>, and passing into the middle of the <i>Choir</i>, make
again their double Reverences, and proceed out of the
<i>Choir</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>After them the Choiristers pass in a Body to the middle
of the <i>Choir</i>, and having made their double Reverences,
(as do all that follow,) proceed forth two and two.</p>

<p class='c000'>So do the Vicars of <i>Windsor</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next, the four Petty-Canons come from their Seats, into
the middle of the <i>Choir</i>; and there begin to Sing an
Hymn.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then follows the Serjeant of the Vestry, bearing his
gilt Rod.</p>

<p class='c000'>After him the Gentlemen of the Chappel at <i>White-Hall</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next the Virger of <i>Windsor Chappel</i>, bearing his Silver
Rod.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the Prebends of <i>Windsor</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>After whom the Officers of Arms come down from the
<i>Altar</i>, and pass on.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the <i>Knights-Companions</i>, the <i>Juniors</i> first.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the <i>Black-Rod</i>, <i>Garter</i>, and <i>Register</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Chancellor and Prelate.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Nobleman that bears the Sword of State.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the Sovereign, above in his Stall, makes a Reverence
toward the <i>Altar</i>, and being descended, another
below; then passes out, and enters under the Canopy,
which waits for him at the <i>Choir Door</i>; the Lord Chamberlain
of the Houshold, if not a Knight of the <i>Order</i>,
attending somewhat behind the side of the Canopy, on the
Sovereign’s right Hand; and the Vice Chamberlain at the
like distance on his left; as in the Grand Procession,
23 <i>Car.</i> II.</p>

<p class='c000'>And lastly, The Band of Pensioners, who attend the
Guard on each side the Sovereign and <i>Knights-Companions</i>,
with their Captain at the Head of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this Order, to this Day, they proceed with great
Devotion; the whole <i>Choir</i> Singing the Office appointed,
<span class='pageno' title='471' id='Page_471'></span>which heretofore was the Litany; but is now generally
a Thanksgiving Hymn.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Grand Procession, when it has been celebrated at
<i>White-Hall</i>, or elsewhere than at <i>Windsor</i>, is for the
most part ordered after the aforesaid manner, as may be
seen by the following Scheme.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Serjeant of the Vestry, with his gilt Rod.</div>
      <div class='line'>Choiristers in Surplices.</div>
      <div class='line'>Gentlemen of the Chappel in Copes.</div>
      <div class='line'>Subdean in a Cope.</div>
      <div class='line'>Officers of Arms.</div>
      <div class='line'>Knights Companions.</div>
      <div class='line'>Officers of the Order.</div>
      <div class='line'>The Sword.</div>
      <div class='line'>The Sovereign under a Canopy, with his Train born up.</div>
      <div class='line'>The Pensioners as before.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But in what this Grand Procession differs from that at
<i>Windsor</i>, we shall here Note.</p>

<p class='c000'>First, Here the Serjeant of the Vestry leads the Proceeding,
and is followed by the Choiristers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Secondly, The Prebends and <i>Choir</i> of <i>Windsor</i>, and the
Alms-Knights, are here wanting.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thirdly, The Subdean and Dean of the Chappel are
taken in, and proceed next to the Gentlemen of the Chappel,
to whom the Sovereign’s Almoner has sometimes
joined himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fourthly, Whilst the <i>Knights-Companions</i> are descending
from their Stalls, the Gentlemen of the Chappel go into
the Vestry, to put on their Copes; but the Dean of the
Chappel hath his brought into the <i>Choir</i>, which he puts
on below, under his Seat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fifthly and Lastly, In Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>’s Reign, the
Ladies Attendants went with the Pensioners on either side
the Sovereign.</p>

<p class='c000'>To contribute more to the Pomp and State of this
great Ceremony, a Canopy is born over the Sovereign’s
Head, by Knights and Gentlemen of Quality, while he
passeth in Procession, till he return to the <i>Choir Door</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Persons appointed to carry the Canopy, <i>Anno</i> 11
<i>Hen.</i> VIII. were four Knights of the Body, when four
other Knights bore four Wax Tapers; but since they are
<span class='pageno' title='472' id='Page_472'></span>the Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber in ordinary, who at
the time of the Feast are in waiting, twelve of whom are
appointed for this Service; the Sovereign hath also the
long Train of his Mantle carried up by several of the
young Nobility, who receive notice thereof by the Lord
Chamberlain of the Houshold.</p>

<p class='c000'>In like manner the Lieutenants, or Deputies to the Sovereign,
have had their Train carried up in the Proceedings,
by Persons of Distinction; and the Train of a Stranger
King, personally present at <i>Windsor</i>, hath also been
born up; and in like manner the Train of a Deputy from
a Stranger King; and lastly, the <i>Knights-Companions</i> have
their Trains carried up by their own Gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Cloaths and Apparel of the Sovereign and <i>Knights-Companions</i>,
and the great variety of rich Jewels which
surround or adorn their Caps, or where else they may
appear most conspicuous, shine with great Lustre.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>Provincial Kings</i>, <i>Heralds</i>, and <i>Pursuivants</i>, habited
in their rich Coats, and going together in one Body,
appear also very conspicuous, from the Royal Arms
of the Sovereign richly Embroidered on them with fine
Gold, Purples and Twist; the Ground of the <i>Provincial
King’s</i> Coats are blue Velvet, the <i>Heralds</i> blue Sattin,
and the <i>Pursuivants</i> blue Damask.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Habit in which the Canons of the College proceed,
is also peculiar; for though, as Clergymen, they
are vested in Linen Surplices at all times of Divine Service,
yet at this Solemnity they wear a Mantle over those
Surplices, which is a Habit appointed for them, from the
Foundation of the <i>Order</i>; these Mantles are of <i>Murry Taffety</i>,
and on the right Shoulder is an Escutcheon of St.
<i>George</i>’s <i>Arms</i> within a Rundlet, Embroidered with Gold
and Silk, which is bought at their own Charge.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Gentlemen of the Sovereign’s Chappel, the Petty-Canons,
and Vicars of <i>Windsor</i>, appear in Habits more
glorious, being all (or the most part of them) vested in
rich Copes of Cloth of Gold, or most costly Embroideries;
but the Children of the Chappel and Choiristers,
proceed habited in Surplices of white Linen; lastly, the
Habits of the Alms-Knights [a Mantle and Kirtle] are
not unremarkable both for Colour and Materials, which
appear suitable to their Age and Degree. The Mantles
are of Cloth, which the <i>Statutes</i> appoint to be of a red
<span class='pageno' title='473' id='Page_473'></span>Colour, with a Shield of the Arms of St. <i>George</i>, but
without a Garter to surround them.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this Grand Proceeding, the Habits entertain the Beholders
with a very delightful Prospect, being so ordered,
that the Grave are placed between those that are Rich and
Gallant; and to add to the greater Shew of this Solemn
Ceremony, the Registers of the <i>Order</i> make mention of
divers Persons of Rank and Quality, who put themselves
on the Duty of Attendance on their Sovereign, because
related to his Service, though in reference to the <i>Order</i>
not so concerned as to be taken into the Proceeding;
such are divers of the Nobility, sometimes great Ladies,
many considerable Officers of the Houshold, and other
Courtiers, all richly habited and attired.</p>

<p class='c000'>To complete the Pomp of this great Solemnity, we
may (in the last Place,) fitly remember the Musick, as a
part thereof, the <i>Choirs</i> of the Sovereign’s Chappel at
St. <i>James</i>’s, and at <i>Windsor</i>, being united, all Singing the
sacred Hymn together, while the Grand Procession devoutly
passeth; and on their return to the <i>Choir Door</i>, the
Alms-Knights first advance into it, and after double Reverences
ascend above the <i>Haut Pas</i>’s to the <i>Altar</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next the Choiristers, and in like manner the Vicars,
Petty-Canons of <i>Windsor</i>, Gentlemen of the Chappel, and
Prebends, go to their Seats.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the Officers of Arms pass up, and join to the
Alms-Knights. After this the <i>Knights-Companions</i> enter,
and stand before their Stalls.</p>

<p class='c000'>The like doth the <i>Black-Rod</i>, <i>Garter</i>, and <i>Register</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>As also the <i>Chancellor</i> and <i>Prelate</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then doth the Sovereign take his Royal Stall.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>Knights-Companions</i> ascend their Stalls.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Officers of the <i>Order</i> sit down on their Forms, in
the same Manner and Order, and with like Reverences,
as at their Entrance into the <i>Choir</i>, on the Eve of the
Feast.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the Prelate, with two Prebends, (appointed to
read the Epistle and Gospel,) are conducted, the one by
the Serjeants of the Vestry, the other by the Virger, up
to the <i>Altar</i>, (which they approach with usual Reverences,)
the Prelate passing to the North-side, and the Prebends to
the South, to finish the remaining part of Divine Service.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='474' id='Page_474'></span>Whereupon the Officers of Arms descend into the <i>Choir</i>;
And</p>

<p class='c000'>The Alms-Knights go down to their Seats, which,
while they are so doing, the two Prebends put on their
Copes at the South-side of the <i>Altar</i>. This done, the
Prelate begins the second Service, which hath been celebrated,
since the time of the Reformation, according to the
Book of <i>Common-Prayer</i>, and is the same commonly used
on any other Feast Day; excepting a peculiar Epistle and
Gospel; the first being the thirty third Chapter of <i>Deuteronomy</i>,
and the latter the fifth Chapter of St. <i>John</i>, beginning
at the twenty fourth Verse, and ending at the
thirtieth; which being read, the Creed is Sung.</p>

<p class='c000'>We may here Note, that before the Reformation, it belonged
to the Abbot of <i>Tower-Hill</i> to read the Gospel,
and to the Prior of <i>Medemenham</i> in <i>Norfolk</i>, to read the
Epistle.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>The Offering of Gold and Silver.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 4: This Ceremony, whether it be performed in the
Sovereign’s Chappel at <i>Windsor</i>, or in any other Church
or Chappel, is one and the same, (except the Sovereign’s
Offering of Gold and Silver, instead of the <i>Bezant</i>,) which
is peculiar to <i>Windsor</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The accustomed time of Offering on the Feast Day, is
mentioned <i>Anno</i> 22 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. to be after the Sovereign’s
return to his Stall from the Grand Procession, in the time
of High Mass, and at this Day begins immediately after
this first Sentence of the Offertory is pronounced by the
Prelate.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Let your Light so shine before men</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'>This said, the Organ begins to Play, and forthwith
a Groom and Page of the removing Wardrobe, (with Reverence
first made,) unrol a long Carpet, and spread it before
the <i>Altar</i>; which being done, the <i>Alms-Knights</i> first,
next the <i>Pursuivants</i>, <i>Heralds</i>, and <i>Provincial Kings</i>, ascend
in usual Order, and flank the Carpet on both sides.
Then <i>Garter</i> steps from his Seat, and after double Reverences,
and the usual manner of waving his Rod, the
<i>Knights-Companions</i> descend in their accustom’d Order,
and stand before their Stalls.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='475' id='Page_475'></span>After this, <i>Black-Rod</i> goes from his Seat to the <i>Altar</i>,
towards which, making a single Reverence, he turns his
Back, and immediately the Groom of <a id='removing' name='removing'></a>the removing Wardrobe
delivereth him a little Carpet, anciently of Silk,
now of Cloth of Gold; and the said Groom holds on
his Arms a Cushion of Cloth of Gold, for the Sovereign to
Kneel upon, at the time of his Offering, which the <i>Black-Rod</i>
forthwith lays on the upper <i>Haut Pas</i> before the <i>Altar</i>,
and each of them, as well in delivering, as receiving
the Cushion, kiss it.</p>

<p class='c000'>After this, the Prelate of the <i>Order</i> takes a gilt Bason to
receive the Sovereign’s Offering, and stands before the
middle of the <i>Altar</i>, with one of the Prebends to assist him,
at which time the Sovereign arising makes his Reverence
towards the <i>Altar</i>, and then descending, makes a little
Reverence below, and ascends towards the <i>Altar</i> with his
Attendants, and being come into the middle of the <i>Choir</i>,
he makes another Reverence, and at the first <i>Haut Pas</i>
his last.</p>

<p class='c000'>He that bears the Sovereign’s Offering, is either the <i>Senior</i>
Knight, the Prince, or the greatest Estate among the
<i>Knights-Companions</i> then present, and no other Person, (of
what Degree soever) if he be not of this Noble Fraternity,
performs this Service.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sovereign being come to the upper <i>Haut Pas</i> kneels,
at which Instant <i>Black-Rod</i> on his Knee delivers (with
Assay) the Sovereign’s Offering to the <i>Senior</i> Knight, or
other Person nominated, and he kneeling presents it to the
Sovereign, which he immediately Offers into the Bason
held by the Prelate, and then ariseth, and is conducted and
attended, as when he came up to Offer; at the Entrance
into his Stall, he turns and makes a Reverence, and his
Attendants also bow towards the <i>Altar</i>; and being attended
into his Stall, doth the like again, and then reposeth
himself in his Seat.</p>

<p class='c000'>An Entry is made in the <i>Red-Book</i>, <i>Anno</i> 6 <i>Car.</i> I. <i>That
whereas in other Places</i> (<i>besides</i> Windsor) <i>the Sovereign is
wont to Offer a certain Gold Piece, (vulgarly called a Bezant)
to be redeemed afterwards at a certain Price; the Usher of
the</i> Black-Rod <i>having been admonished, that in these Services
there is no Redemption to be made, should never present
the Bezant at</i> Windsor <i>to the Sovereign, but Gold and Silver
of English Money.</i></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='476' id='Page_476'></span>When the Sovereign is absent, and the Lieutenant Offers
for him, he performs the Ceremony as follows.</p>

<p class='c000'>First, (After the Preparations made for the Offering, as
aforesaid,) he descends from his Stall with the usual Reverences,
and goes to the Steps ascending the Sovereign’s
Stall, and there stands a while; then making his double
Obeysance, he proceeds towards the <i>Altar</i> (the Officers
of the <i>Order</i> going before him,) with one other Reverence
in the middle of the <i>Choir</i>, and another at the first <i>Haut
Pas</i> of the <i>Altar</i>; the Carpet and Cushion is spread and
laid for him, as is for the Sovereign, and the Offering also
given in the same way, and the Lieutenant kneeling puts it
in the Bason, and returns to the Sovereign’s Stall in the
same Order, <i>&amp;c.</i> he came; where standing a while again
before it, he makes a Reverence towards it, and then
goes up into his own Stall, where (if it fall out that the
Lieutenant is not the <i>Senior</i> Knight,) he stays to receive
the Reverences of all the <i>Knights-Companions</i> his <i>Seniors</i>,
as they go up to Offer, and when his own turn comes to
Offer, he descends with a double Reverence, and proceeds
up with his Fellow, (if present) and Offers for himself in
his own Place, but his Train is then let down, the Carpet,
<i>&amp;c.</i> taken away, and only two Officers of Arms
(but none of the <i>Order</i>) proceeds before him, and when
he has Offer’d, he returns to his Stall.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it seems, 7 <i>Jac.</i> I. that <i>Garter</i> alone, on the Feast
Day, brought up the Prince, then the Sovereign’s Lieutenant,
when he came to Offer for himself, which Service
ought to have been performed by <i>Clarenceux</i> and <i>Norroy</i>,
which was an oversight in <i>Garter</i>; as likewise his bringing
down at the same, the <i>Knights-Companions</i> out of their
Stalls to Offer, before the Epistle and Gospel were Read,
contrary to the usage of former times; by which they
were kept a tedious time waiting below in the <i>Choir</i>,
before the Offering began. But 11 <i>Jac.</i> I. the Prince was
brought up by <i>Clarenceux</i> and <i>Norroy</i>, when he came to
Offer, and not by <i>Garter</i>. When the Lieutenant hath
Offered for himself, he returns to the lower end of the
Stalls, and passes to his own, where having paid the usual
Reverences, he enters it, and is ready to receive the Reverences
of all the other <i>Knights-Companions</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as the Sovereign, or his Lieutenant, is returned
to his Stall, the two Provincial Kings pass down into
<span class='pageno' title='477' id='Page_477'></span>the middle of the <i>Choir</i>, where making Reverences jointly
to the <i>Altar</i>, and next to the Sovereign, <i>Clarenceux</i> turns
himself to the <i>Senior</i> Knight, and makes him a third Reverence,
while <i>Norroy</i> at the same Instant does the same
to the next <i>Junior</i> Knight, and so both, as an intimation
of their going up to Offer; then each King retires a little
backward toward the Stalls: In the mean time, the two
<i>Senior</i> Knights draw near together, and making double
Reverences, <i>Clarenceux</i> and <i>Norroy</i> step forth, and pass
up before them, till they arrive near the Prelate; (or if
the <i>Senior</i> Knight be without his Opposite, then he is
brought up single,) then making their Reverences, first
towards the <i>Altar</i>, next to the Knights, <i>Clarenceux</i> retires
to the right side, and <i>Norroy</i> to the left, waiting for the
return of the Knights, who are kneeling on the uppermost
<i>Haut Pas</i> of the <i>Altar</i>, making their Offering. Which
humble Ceremony of kneeling, not being heretofore used,
was fixed by a Decree of 4 <i>Car.</i> I.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>Knights-Companions</i> Offerings are both of Silver
and Gold, which is receiv’d by two of the Prebends, or by
one Prebend and one Chantor, anciently by one Chantor
only, when the Offering is at <i>Windsor</i>; but by the Dean
of the Chappel, when at <i>White-Hall</i>. The Offering
being made, the <i>Knights-Companions</i> rise, and forthwith
divide themselves, <i>Clarenceux</i> conducting the <i>Senior</i>
Knight to the lower end of the Stalls on the Sovereign’s
side; and <i>Norroy</i> the next <i>Junior</i> Knight, to the lower
end of the Stalls on the Prince’s side; and at parting
make their Reverences, and return to their Stations before
the <i>Altar</i>. The Knights, at their Entrance into the Stalls,
make their double Reverences together, and then pass on
to their own; where making the like Reverences, they
take their Seats.</p>

<p class='c000'>But if any Stranger King be present at the Offering, he
does not retire to his Seat, by the lower end of the Stalls,
but along the <i>Choir</i>, as does the Sovereign, the same
way he proceeded up: So did the King of <i>Denmark</i>,
4 <i>Jac.</i> I.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Ceremonies of the two <i>Senior</i> Knights Offering
being finished, the two <i>Senior Heralds</i> observing their last
Reverences, pass down into the <i>Choir</i>, in the same manner
as did <i>Clarenceux</i> and <i>Norroy</i>, to bring up the next two
<i>Senior</i> Knights to Offer, who use all the same Ceremonies,
<span class='pageno' title='478' id='Page_478'></span>and are conducted back in like manner to the <i>Altar</i>;
and so of the other, brought up by the two next <i>Senior
Heralds</i>; <i>Clarenceaux</i> and <i>Norroy</i> beginning again, if
there are more Knights than the <i>Heralds</i> in one Course
supply; and after them the <i>Heralds</i> again, till the whole
is ended: And here it may be noted, that where any
Knight goeth single to Offer, he hath nevertheless two
<i>Heralds</i> to attend him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Touching the Offerings themselves, made in the Chappel
of <i>Windsor</i>, they belong of right to the Dean and Prebends,
being conferr’d on them by the <i>Statutes</i> of the
College: And ordained also, that the <i>Chantor</i> should see
them receiv’d, and faithfully kept; and at the end of
every Month, or Weekly, if the College required it, give
an Account of what was receiv’d: All which was confirmed
by King <i>Edward</i> III. the Bishop, Dean, and Chapter
of <i>Salisbury</i>, to whose Jurisdiction the College of
<i>Windsor</i> belongs; and also by the Bishop of <i>Winchester</i>,
Prelate of the <i>Garter</i>, 1352. But Dr. <i>Montague</i>, Bishop
of <i>Winchester</i>, at the Feast at <i>Windsor</i>, 21 <i>Jac.</i> I. challenged
a right to the Offerings; and Bishop <i>Andrews</i> did <i>de
Facto</i> both receive, and keep the Offerings, whenever he
officiated at <i>Windsor</i>. But on complaint of the Dean and
Prebends of <i>Windsor</i>, this matter was referred to the Chapter;
yet we do not find that any final or positive Determination
was ever made to the time of the Restauration,
from which time the right of the Dean and Canons has
never been disputed, and the <i>Statutes</i> have duly taken
Place.</p>

<p class='c000'>What has usually been offered, either in Gold or Silver,
we shall see by the Account given in by the Bishop of
<i>Winchester</i>, 4 <i>Car.</i> I. at St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Feast</i> at <i>Windsor</i>,
<i>September</i> 24.</p>

<p class='c000'>The whole Offering of the eight Knights, is four
Pounds fifteen Shillings, <i>viz.</i> in Gold ten Shillings each,
and in Silver two; excepting the Lord Steward, whose
Offering in Silver was only one Shilling; besides the Sovereign’s
<i>Bezant</i> redeemable.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Offerings on the twenty <a id='fifth' name='fifth'></a>fifth Day.</p>

<p class='c000'>His Majesty’s Offering in Gold one Pound, and in Silver
ten Shillings.</p>

<p class='c000'>The eight <i>Knights-Companions</i> the same as the Day
before; the whole, besides the King’s <i>Bezant</i>, eleven Pounds.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='479' id='Page_479'></span>When all the Knights have offered, and are returned to
their Stalls, the Chancellor of the <i>Order</i> makes his Reverences;
and after him, the <i>Register</i>, <i>Garter</i>, and <i>Black-Rod</i>,
theirs together, and take their Seats: Next, the Carpet
being rolled up by the Groom and Page of the removing
Wardrobe, the <i>Provincial Kings</i>, <i>Heralds</i>, and <i>Pursuivants</i>,
and last of all the Alms-Knights, make their Reverences,
and pass into the <i>Choir</i>, where they remain till the
Prelate has finished the second Service; who, conducted by
the Serjeant of the Vestry, comes down from the <i>Altar</i> with
his accustomed Reverences to his Seat. After whom,
the two Prebends are brought down by the Virger, who
making their usual Reverences take their Seats.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>The Return to the Presence.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 6. Immediately after, all prepare to pass out of the
<i>Choir</i>, and to proceed back to the Presence Chamber,
which is done in every particular as it is in the return of
the Sovereign from the first <i>Vespers</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Proceeding passes on through the South-Door of
the Chappel, and here the Trumpets are taken in, and
placed before the Alms-Knights, and sound all the way
to the Guard Chamber; at which time the Drums and
Fifes begin to beat and play. Thence the Proceeding
passes into the Presence Chamber, whither it ought to go,
before the Sovereign pass into the great Hall to Dinner;
and here the <i>Knights-Companions</i> take their usual Stands;
and after the Sovereign’s Salutation, and their Reverences,
the Sovereign retires into the Privy Chamber, and the
Knights likewise retire till Dinner is ready.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Of the Dinner on the Feast Day.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 7. As soon as the Sovereign hath notice given him, that
the first Mess is set on the Table, the Sovereign and
<i>Knights-Companions</i> come out of the Privy Lodgings into
the Presence Chamber, attended by the Officers of the
<i>Order</i>, and seat themselves in the same manner, as at the
Supper on the Eve of the Feast: The Musick sounding
<span class='pageno' title='480' id='Page_480'></span>whilst the said Mess is carrying up; which is in the following

<p class='c008'>The Sovereign hath most frequently sat alone, though
sometimes heretofore he hath been pleased to admit some
of the <i>Knights-Companions</i> to sit at the Table with him;
but this Honour has not been offered to any of them since
the Reign of Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>. As soon as the Sovereign
is placed, the <i>Knights-Companions</i> put on their Caps,
and remaining covered, retire against the Tables prepared
for them; where Water is brought them by a
Gentleman of Quality; and having washed, they all sit
down.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Order of passing to their Seats at the Table, 19
<i>Car.</i> II. and so appointed to be observed for the future,
was after the following manner. First, The Duke of
<i>York</i> entered the Rails at the upper end of the Table, and
passed down the hither side, to the lower end, and thence
to the bench-side to his Place: In like manner followed all
the other Knights, according to the Seniority of their Stalls,
as it is ordained they shall sit, and not according to their
Estates or Dignities, (except the Sons of Stranger Kings,
Princes, and Dukes,) and all on the right Hand, or farther
side of their Table, not one against another, but two
and two at a Table to a Mess, and those whose Opposites
are wanting to sit alone, and have a whole Mess.
Their Meat being usually brought up by the Yeomen of
the Guard; and are attended by some of the Gentlemen
Pensioners, and others of the Sovereigns Servants, two to
each Table.</p>

<p class='c000'>It appears that anciently the Officers of the <i>Order</i> had
a Table allowed them in the great Hall, and sat covered
<span class='pageno' title='481' id='Page_481'></span>in the Sovereign’s Presence; but on the Eve of the Feast,
10 <i>Car.</i> I. it was ordered in <i>Chapter</i>, That they should be
at their Choice, to keep the Feast privately by themselves,
or sit uncovered where the Sovereign dined. Whereupon,
from that time, they forbore sitting in the Hall, or where
else the Sovereign and <i>Knights-Companions</i> sat. It likewise
appears, that the Officers of Arms did anciently sit
in St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Hall</i>, at a Table joined to that, at which
the Officers of the <i>Order</i> sat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before the Entrance of the Sovereign’s second Course,
he stands up and drinks to the <i>Knights-Companions</i>, (and
so it is remembred to be done by <i>Phil.</i> and <i>Mar.</i>) they
standing all the while uncovered, till they have all pledged
him: Which done, the Officers of Arms make themselves
ready, at the lower end of the Hall, to proceed up in the
following <i>Order</i>.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c002'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Garter.</div>
      <div class='line'>Clarenceux and Norroy.</div>
      <div class='line'>Heralds two and two.</div>
      <div class='line'>Pursuivants two and two.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>And so altogether make their Reverence to the Sovereign,
and proceed near the side of the Knights Table, till
they come to the middle of the Hall, where, after another
Reverence made, they go still forward; and when <i>Garter</i>
has passed about two Yards beyond the Knights Table,
and come near the <i>Haut Pas</i> ascending the Sovereign’s
State, they make the like Reverence again jointly. Then
<i>Garter</i> with a loud and audible Voice cries Largess thrice,
though anciently but twice.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon <i>Garter’s</i> beginning to cry Largess, all the <i>Knights-Companions</i>,
unless Kings and great Princes, if any be
present, stand up uncovered, till he has made an end;
(which Custom, it seems, 7 <i>Car.</i> I. had been discontinued
for some time.) Then <i>Garter</i> proceeds, and Proclaims the
Sovereign’s Stiles and Titles of Honour, first in <i>Latin</i>,
after in <i>French</i>, and lastly in <i>English</i>; he and the Officers
of Arms making a Reverence between; and at the end
join altogether in crying Largess thrice, and then all make
Reverence together.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hereupon, sometimes the Treasurer of the Houshold
puts the Sovereign’s Largess, which is ten Pounds in Gold,
<span class='pageno' title='482' id='Page_482'></span>into <i>Garter</i>’s Hat; and this is afterwards divided among
the Officers of Arms, according to Custom. But <i>Anno</i>
23 <i>Car.</i> II. the <i>Black-Rod</i> put the Largess into <i>Garter</i>’s
Hat. This being finished, all the Officers of Arms retire
about three Yards backward, keeping their Faces towards
the Sovereign, and there make a Reverence, and so a
second, and thence retire out of the Hall to Dinner.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Ceremony ended, the Sovereign’s second Course
is brought up; first the Serjeants at Arms, next the Treasurer
and Comptroller of the Houshold, next the Sewer,
then the Gentlemen-Pensioners, bearing the Messes; then
the Cofferer and Master of the Houshold, the two Clerks
of the Green-Cloth, the two Clerks Comptrollers, and
lastly the two Clerks of the Kitchin, habited in their
Gowns, and their Caps in their Hands. And after the
Sovereign’s Table is compleatly furnished, the second Course
is served up to the Knights Table by the Yeomen of the
Guard, in such Order as was the first.</p>

<p class='c000'>But where any <i>Knight-Companion</i> happens to be installed
at this Grand Feast, and is present at Dinner,
then <i>Garter</i>, and the Officers of Arms, proceed in Order,
(after they have proclaimed the Sovereign’s Stile,) from
the lower end of the Hall, till they come before the new
installed Knight’s Mess, and there <i>Garter</i> cries Largess
once, and Proclaims his Stile in <i>English</i> only; and then
retires to Dinner.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the last Place comes in the Banquet, brought to
the Sovereign’s Table by the Pensioners, in the same Order
as the Messes; (only in Place of the Clerk of the
Kitchin, the Chief Clerk of the Spicery waits,) and the
Banquet for the <i>Knights-Companions</i>, by the Yeomen of
the Guard.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dinner being ended, the <i>Knights-Companions</i> rise first,
and having washed, place themselves a little below the
State, in their usual Order, and make their Reverences to
the Sovereign. After which, the Sovereign hears Grace
said by the Prelate, then Water is brought in the usual
way, and the Sovereign washes: Which done, the Knights
making again due Reverence to the Sovereign, he puts off
his Cap, and salutes them, and then proceeds as usually to
the Presence Chamber, with the Knights and Officers of
the <i>Order</i> before him, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='483' id='Page_483'></span>In like manner does the Sovereign’s Lieutenant proceed
from the Presence to the Hall, or such other Room
where the Dinner is prepared, only his Place at the Table
is a little on the left Hand the Cloth of State, or at the
end of the Table: And after Dinner, he returns to the
Presence in the same Order as the Sovereign does.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>The Ceremonies belonging to the second</i> Vespers.</h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 8. The usual time for Proceeding to the <i>Chapter-House</i>,
hath usually been about four a Clock in the Afternoon,
but sometimes not before five, by reason of the
length of the Dinner. The Proceeding is as at other times;
and when the Sovereign and Knights have made a Cavalcade
of it on the Eve, or on the Feast Day, the same has
been observed at the Proceeding to the second <i>Vespers</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been customary to hold a <i>Chapter</i> before the second
<i>Vespers</i>, for the regulation of the Affairs of the <i>Order</i>.
When the second <i>Vespers</i> are ended, the Proceeding passes
out of the <i>Choir</i> in the very same Order as at the first
<i>Vespers</i>; but <i>Anno</i> 15 <i>Car.</i> I. it happening to be late ere
the second <i>Vespers</i> ended, the Sovereign did not go to the
Presence Chamber, but proceeded directly to the great
Hall to Supper by Torch Light.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Of the Supper on the Evening of the Feast Day.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 9. It has not been frequently known, that the Sovereign
hath supped publickly in St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Hall</i> on the
Feast Day; but when it happens, as 14 <i>Car.</i> I. the Proceeding
thither, and return, are in all respects performed
as at the Supper on the Eve. And if the Sovereign’s Lieutenant
hath on this Night supped publickly, then it was in
the Presence Chamber, where he sat alone at the Sovereign’s
Table, as at other times.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='484' id='Page_484'></span>
  <h2 id='ch22' class='c005'>CAP. XXII.<br /> <br /><i>The Ceremonies observed on the last Day of the Feast.</i></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Of the Proceeding to the Choir.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 1.</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c009'>The
manner of Proceeding to the <i>Chapter-House</i>
is performed in the same manner as it
was on the Eve of the Feast; and differs only
in this Point; that then the Sovereign and Knights are obliged
by the <i>Statutes</i> to proceed in full Robes; here, by
the Indulgence of King <i>Henry</i> VIII’s <i>Statutes</i>, all are dispensed
with, except the upper Robe or Mantle: And
as then the Image of St. <i>George</i> was worn Pendant
at the Coller of the <i>Order</i>, now a blue Ribbond sufficeth;
and instead of a Cap and Feather, only their ordinary
Hats.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the ancient Custom to Celebrate a <i>Chapter</i> in the
Morning of the last Day of the Feast, before the Sovereign
proceeded to the Chappel, chiefly to make Election
of Knights, where any Stall is void; which has sometimes
been held, when the Sovereign did not go to the
Chappel, in the Privy Chamber, and then the Lieutenant,
waving the <i>Chapter-House</i>, proceeds straight on to the
Chappel, and enters at the South Door.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Of the elect Knights proceeding into the</i> Choir.</h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 2. Where an Election has been made of a Person
then present at Court, he is called into the <i>Chapter-House</i>
by <i>Garter</i>, according to the usual manner; and having
been invested with the <i>George</i> and <i>Garter</i>, he usually passed
in the Proceeding to the Chappel, whether it were
from the <i>Chapter-House</i>, or Presence Chamber; and in
this ordinary Apparel, always bare-headed; the Place
allowed him in the Proceeding being between the <i>Knights-Companions</i>
and the Officers of Arms: But if two
<span class='pageno' title='485' id='Page_485'></span>Knights have been elected, they then proceed together,
before the <i>Knights-Companions</i>. At his Entrance into the
<i>Choir</i>, the elect Knight is placed by <i>Garter</i>, next before
the lowest Stall; or if there be two elected, and both
proceed to the Chappel, they are placed in the two lowest
Stalls; where they are to stand all Service time, unless
upon Licence to sit, as they have sometimes obtained.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Of the Ceremonies performed at Divine Service.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 3. In this Morning Service, before the Reformation
of our Church, the Mass of <i>Requiem</i> was solemnly Sung,
for the Souls of the <i>Knights-Companions</i>, and all faithful
Souls departed, which was provided for by the <i>Statutes</i>.
As likewise, that all the Knights should be present thereat,
unless upon License obtained, or special Case to the contrary.
At this Celebration, was the deceased Knights
Atchievements also offered with solemn Ceremony; of
which we shall speak presently.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another Ceremony belonging to the Service of this
Morning, is the Offering of Gold and Silver, which
(when the first Sentence of the Offertory has been pronounced,)
is again performed by the Sovereign and
<i>Knights-Companions</i>; the Ceremonies being the same, in
all particulars, as are observed at the like Offering on the
Feast Day.</p>

<p class='c000'>Divine Service being ended, the Sovereign and <i>Knights-Companions</i>
frequently proceed to the <i>Chapter-House</i>, and
there put off their Mantles, and therewith the Ceremonies
of this Grand Feast determine.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='486' id='Page_486'></span>
  <h2 id='ch23' class='c005'>CAP. XXIII.<br /> <br /><i>The Observation of the Grand Feast by absent Knights.</i></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Absent Knights enjoined to observe the Grand Feast.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 1.</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c009'>Having
shewn with what Magnificence and Ceremony
the Feast of St. <i>George</i> has been, and
ought to be observed; as also how strictly
the <i>Statutes</i> oblige the <i>Knights-Companions</i> to appear annually
thereat; and what severe Penalties they are liable
to, if absent, except on reasonable Cause of Absence.
Yet lest the Honour might receive diminution, from too
small an Appearance at its publick Solemnities; it was
farther at the Institution of the <i>Order</i> Decreed: <i>That
none of them should depart the Kingdom, without first acquainting
the Sovereign, and obtaining his special Leave and
License</i>; nevertheless the Sovereign granted them License
to go beyond Sea, before the rest of his Subjects, if they
were dispos’d to undertake any Military Expedition, from
whence any Glory of Knighthood might be hop’d for.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was then by the eleventh Article also ordained; (on
whatsoever occasion the Absence might be,) <i>That wheresoever
any of the</i> Knights-Companions <i>resided, during the
said Feast, they should wear their Mantles of the</i> Order,
<i>from the Hour of the first Vespers on the Eve of St.</i> George,
<i>till the second</i> Vespers <i>on the Feast Day were finished; as
they should have done, had they been present in Person,
with the Sovereign or his Deputy, during the whole Celebration
of the Feast; (in case they were not deprived of their
Liberty) the Prorogation of the Feast notwithstanding</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>King <i>Henry</i> VIII. observing the Custom of these Celebrations
began to be neglected, in the eleventh year of his
Reign, enlarged the Law in this particular, explaining
the said eleventh Article. He declar’d and enjoin’d the
wearing of the whole Habit on the Eve of St. <i>George</i>, if
the <i>Knight-Companion</i> were not under restraint. Then he
<span class='pageno' title='487' id='Page_487'></span>enumerated the times for wearing it; to wit, on the Eve,
at all times of Divine Service, Dinner and Supper; unless
in case of War, Sickness, or other just impediment;
when it was sufficient, if the absent Knight did wear the
<i>Garter</i> and <i>George</i>, either in a Gold Chain, or Silk Ribbond.</p>

<p class='c000'>And when the same Sovereign, about three Years after,
made a general Reformation of the <i>Statutes</i>, he enjoin’d
the absent <i>Knights-Companions</i> (unless under restraint,) to
prepare a Capital Stall in the Church or Chappel where
he design’d to hear Service, to the Honour of the Sovereign;
in which should be set up the Arms of the <i>Order</i>
within a <i>Garter</i>; and also to erect another Stall, as far in
distance (according to the proportion of the said Church
or Chappel,) from the Stall of the Sovereign, as is the
absent Knights Stall in the Castle of <i>Windsor</i>, and therein
place his own Arms: And should wear the whole Habit
of the <i>Order</i>, and hear Divine Service, such as the Church
ordained for the said time; as well on the Eve and
Morning, as on the Afternoon on the Feast Day. He is likewise
to do Reverence towards the <i>Altar</i>, in the Honour
of God, and after towards the Stall erected for the Sovereign,
at his coming in and going out of the said Church
or Chappel, and, as often as he should pass before the said
Stall. But Emperors, Kings, Princes, or Electors, are
excepted, who may place their Seats and Stalls as they
think fitting.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Decree is still in full force, and we shall only further
observe, that it has been usual for the absent Knight
to perform the same Ceremonies as near as may be to
what is observed at <i>Windsor</i>, and to be attended with a
convenient Number of Gentlemen before him, well habited,
with the Officers of his Houshold, <i>&amp;c.</i> who, according
to their Degrees, proceed two and two together
bare-headed; and that he Dines and Sups alone at all times,
unless a <i>Knight-Companion</i> be with him.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>How it is to be observed in Case of Sickness.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 2. In Case of Sickness, if the absent Knight was
only confin’d to his Chamber, the Custom was to prepare
a Capital Stall for the Sovereign, in the Chamber where
<span class='pageno' title='488' id='Page_488'></span>he lay, and another Stall for himself, placed according to
the before-mentioned directions, to remain during the
Feast; in which Room Divine Offices were celebrated.
And if the absent Knight was so Sick as to keep his Bed,
then his whole Habit of the <i>Order</i> was laid thereon; and
upon this Account <i>Ambrose</i>, Earl of <i>Warwick</i>, falling Ill
at <i>Greenwich</i>, when St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Day</i> was there celebrated,
<i>Anno</i> 30 <i>Eliz.</i> retir’d to his Chamber, and sat in his
Robes.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>In what manner the Feast hath been observ’d by absent Knights.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 3. Of this, the <i>Black-Book</i> of the <i>Order</i> gives a very
considerable Precedent; Namely, the Feast of St. <i>George</i>
held at the Palace of <i>Hereford</i>, by Prince <i>Arthur</i>, 15
<i>Hen.</i> VII. being then in his Government of the Principality
of <i>Wales</i>; and had with him Sir <i>Richard Pool</i>, one
of the <i>Knights-Companions</i>; where every thing, according
to the form of the <i>Statutes</i>, was duly observed. The Prince’s
Sword was born before his Stall, and the Service performed
by his <i>Herald</i> with great exactness. Likewise the
Sovereign’s <i>Herald</i> stood all the while before the Sovereign’s
Stall, which was adorned with accustomed Ornaments;
and the Bishop, who performed Divine Service,
had his Seat erected near the High <i>Altar</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are other Instances, as particularly those observed
by Sir <i>Henry Sidney</i>, at <i>Shrewsbury</i> and <i>Ludlow</i>, 23
and 24 Queen <i>Eliz.</i> which were very remarkable.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the observation of the Feast, by a Knight beyond
Sea, there is an Instance in <i>Robert</i>, Earl of <i>Leicester</i>, Lieutenant
for Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>, Governor, and Captain General
of the united Provinces, and there celebrated the
Feast, 1586. He had an Escutcheon of the <i>Order</i>, impailed
with the Sovereign’s Arms, fixt to the front of his
House, so also to the back of her Stall in the Church, and
his own Arms at the back of his own Stall.</p>

<p class='c000'>He proceeded on Horse-back to the Church, a Pursuivant
riding before him, wearing a King of Arms’s Coat;
who, after Sermon, proceeded before him to the Offering;
which he made for the Sovereign and himself; Service
being ended, he returned to his Lodging, and dined with
great Solemnity.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Dispensations for Absence granted during Life.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>§ 5. Sometimes Dispensations for Absence have been
obtained for Life, upon the Petite of the <i>Knights-Companions</i>
setting forth their Age and Infirmity: An Instance
of which, we find was granted to the Lord <i>Dacrees</i>, 26
<i>Hen.</i> VIII. and the Earl of <i>Derby</i>, 14 <i>Car.</i> I. and the
Lord <i>Musgrave</i>; but both with this Restriction; that the
absent should be obliged to send to <i>Garter</i> for his Escutcheons,
at the same time that he sent his Excuse, and
Petite for Dispensation; and should solemnly keep in his
own House the Feast, with all the sacred Rites and Ceremonies,
in his Robes, and other Ornaments, if Health
permit; and in Case of Sickness, upon his Bed, according
to the ancient <i>Statutes</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Act was thought of so great Importance to be observed,
that the Chancellor was ordered to transcribe it,
and send it to each of the <i>Knights-Companions</i>; acquainting
them at the same time, with the Penalties they should
be liable to, if they neglected the least Punctilio. And
the like was again observed, and repeated to them, before
the Feast of the ensuing Year.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch24' class='c005'>CAP. XXIV.<br /> <br /><i>The Degradation of a</i> Knight-Companion.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>§ 1.</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c009'>The
Ensigns of the <i>Order</i> are not to be withdrawn
from a Knight, during Life, unless
Guilty of some of those Marks of Reproach,
set down in King <i>Henry</i> VIII’s <i>Statutes</i>, <i>viz.</i> Heresy,
Treason, or Flying from Battle: It has sometimes been
found, that Prodigality has been made a fourth Point,
where a Knight has so wasted his Estate, as to be incapable
of supporting his Dignity. The Pretence for divesting
<span class='pageno' title='490' id='Page_490'></span><i>William</i>, Lord <i>Paget</i>, 6 <i>Edw.</i> VI. was, his not being
a Gentleman of Blood, both by Father and Mother.
But Felony comes not within the compass of this <i>Statute</i>,
as not being expresly mentioned among the Reproaches
there Summ’d up; and so it was adjudged in a <i>Chapter</i>,
14 <i>Jac.</i> I. in the Case of <i>Robert</i>, Earl of <i>Somerset</i>, then
lately condemned for that Fact, whereon his Hatchments
were not removed.</p>

<p class='c000'>When a <i>Knight-Companion</i> is found Guilty of any of
the Offences mentioned in King <i>Henry</i> VIII’s <i>Statutes</i>, he
is usually degraded at the next <i>Chapter</i>, of which the Sovereign
gives the <i>Knights-Companions</i> previous notice;
and then commands <i>Garter</i> to attend such of them as are
appointed to go to the Convict Knight, who, in a solemn
manner, first takes from him the <i>George</i> and <i>Ribbond</i>, and
then his <i>Garter</i>. And at the ensuing Feast of St. <i>George</i>, or
sooner, if the Sovereign appoint it, publication of his
Crimes and Degradation is made by <i>Garter</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next, <i>Garter</i>, by Warrant to that purpose, takes down
his Atchievement, on which Service he is vested in his
Coat of Arms, and the Officers of Arms standing about
him, the <i>Black-Rod</i> also present; First <i>Garter</i> reads aloud
the Instruments of Degradation, after which one of the
<i>Heralds</i>, who is placed ready on a Ladder set to the back
of the Convict Knight’s Stall, at the Words <i>expelled, and
put from among the Arms</i>, takes his Crest, and violently
casts it down into the <i>Choir</i>, after that his Banner and
Sword; and when the Publication is read out, all the
Officers of Arms spurn the Atchievements out of the <i>Choir</i>,
into the Body of the Church, first the Sword, then the
Banner, and last of all the Crest, so out of the West Door,
thence to the Bridge, and over into the Ditch; and thus
it was done at the Degradation of <i>Edward</i>, Duke of <i>Buckingham</i>,
13 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. Their Plates are likewise taken
down from their Stalls and carried away.</p>

<p class='c000'>Degradation not being alone thought sufficient, it was
debated in <i>Chapter</i>, 32 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. whether the Names
of such <i>Knights-Companions</i> as were convicted of Treason
should remain in the <i>Registers</i>, or be razed out: Where
the Sovereign determined; That wheresoever the Actions
or Names of such Offenders should be found, these Words
[<i>Vah Proditor</i>] should be Written in the Margin; by which
<span class='pageno' title='491' id='Page_491'></span>means the <i>Register</i> wou’d be preserved fair, and not defaced
with razures or blots.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the close of this Section we may observe, that some
<i>Knights-Companions</i>, who have suffered Degradation, have
lived to be restored thereto; being re-elected, and re-invested,
and their Atchievements set up again, by the
Indulgence of the next Reign; as were the Lord <i>Paget</i>’s,
1 <i>Mar.</i> and the Marquiss of <i>Northampton</i>, 1 <i>Eliz.</i> as likewise
the Duke of <i>Norfolk</i>, 1 <i>Mar.</i></p>

<p class='drop-capa0_6_0_6 c009'>As

<p class='c008'>The Monies so collected, (called <i>Obiit Monies</i>) were
by the said Decree appointed to be distributed in Alms-Deeds,
<span class='pageno' title='492' id='Page_492'></span><i>as the Reparation of High Ways</i>, <i>the Relief of the
Poor, &amp;c.</i> The receipt and disbursements of these Sums
were committed to the care of the Dean and Register.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. <i>Ashmole</i>, has made this addition in his Library,
which it will not be out of our way to observe, for
the information of those who may be desirous to know
how the Point then stood; that not withstanding the
aforesaid Order in <i>Chapter</i>, made the 24th of <i>May</i>,
<i>Anno</i> 32 <i>Hen.</i> VIII. for changing the Number of Masses
usually Sung for defunct Knights, into a pecuniary
Rate, according their degrees; the Prayers for Souls
departed, both by private Persons, as also by the Clergy,
in Masses and Exequies; nay farther, to give Alms
to others, and to pray for them, was continued by
the Church of <i>England</i> several Years beyond that space;
for in a Book, entituled the <i>Institution of a Christian Man,
&amp;c.</i> made by the Clergy of <i>England</i>, as appears by the
Subscriptions of the Archbishops, Bishops, and others of
the Clergy to the Preface; dedicated by them to King
<i>Henry</i> VIII. and printed by <i>Thomas Bartelet</i>, the King’s
Printer, <i>Anno</i> 1537. <i>cum Privilegio</i>, the Article of Purgatory
is there set down.</p>

<p class='c000'>But to proceed. This charitable distribution, in a <i>Chapter</i>
held at <i>Greenwich</i>, 5 <i>Edw.</i> VI. was enlarged to the
relief of the Poor in the Town of <i>Windsor</i>, and other
Towns, Villages, and Places, at the discretion of the
Dean of <i>Windsor</i>. And though the said Decree was confirmed
by King <i>Edward</i> VI. Queen <i>Mary</i>, and Queen
<i>Elizabeth</i>, yet for many Years, the Collection of these
<i>Obiit</i> Monies was neglected; till in 9 <i>Car.</i> I. the Earl
of <i>Portland</i>, out of his great Generosity, as well as his Zeal
for restoring so pious a Work, reiterated to the Sovereign
the ancient Decrees made in this Case. Whereupon it
passed in <i>Chapter</i>, that the same should be revived, and for
ever continued; and that the same should begin for the
five Knights, whose Atchievements were offered at that
Feast, <i>viz.</i> the King of <i>Sweden</i>, the Elector Palatine, the
Earls of <i>Northumberland</i>, <i>Banbury</i>, and <i>Rutland</i>. And as
to Stranger Princes, it pleased the Sovereign to express
himself, <i>That as by the</i> Statutes <i>they are left</i> to perform
these Payments by themselves, if they wou’d; so, if it
were not done by them, that both then, and for the future,
the same should be paid by the Sovereign himself.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='493' id='Page_493'></span>Afterwards, all the Sums of Money, to be collected
by Virtue of this Decree, together with the <i>Knights-Companions</i>
Duties, at their first Entrance in the <i>Order</i>,
were employed toward providing Plate for the <i>Altar</i>,
within St. <i>George</i>’s <i>Chappel</i>, which is already treated of.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Of fixing on the Stalls Plates of their Arms and Stiles.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 2. The next thing provided for by the <i>Statutes</i> of Institution,
was the deceased Knight’s Honour; in regard of
which, it was ordained, <i>That when any one of the first
Founders should die, there should be in Metal an Escutcheon
of his Arms, with his Helm, or Crest, fastened at the back
of his Stall, for a Mark of Honour to him that bore them</i>.
And in like manner, <i>that their Successors should have a
like Escutcheon fixed on the back of their Stalls</i>; and to
difference them from those of the first Founders, they
were appointed to be made somewhat less, and to be
placed a little underneath them. But this Article relates
only to the <i>Knights-Companions</i>, not to the Sovereigns of
the <i>Order</i>; nor do we find that any of them had Plates
of their Arms and Stiles set upon the back of their Stalls,
in manner as is before prescribed to the rest of the <i>Knights-Companions</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>King <i>Henry</i> VIII. in his Body of <i>Statutes</i>, alters this
Article in three particulars; first, as to the setting up their
Plates, which he appoints not to be after their Deaths,
but within, after the Installation of every <i>Knight-Companion</i>;
secondly, as to the nature of the Metal, that it
may be such as the Knight shall please himself: And lastly,
as to the size, though he also restrains the <i>Knights-Subjects</i>
to a lesser than those of the first Founders; yet he gives
liberty to the <i>Knights-Strangers</i> to use their Plates and
Fashions at Pleasure. As to the first of these, it has been
pretty duly observed; and indeed the second, of making
them of Copper; but the last, <i>viz.</i> the size, has been
very little regarded; for the very Plates of those Knights
who were soon after installed, and thence downwards,
are larger than those of the first Founders.</p>

<p class='c000'>In tract of time, many of these Memorials were, by
sacrilegious Hands, taken away, which King <i>Charles</i> I.
<span class='pageno' title='494' id='Page_494'></span>taking notice of, and desirous to put a stop to a Mischief
not in his Power to prevent, and to preserve the Remembrance
of the precedent <i>Knights-Companions</i>; commanded
the Dean of <i>Windsor</i> to describe the Stiles of those
that remained in a Book, which he accordingly did, and
deposited the same in the College: But what became of
this Book, could not be afterwards discovered; so that
the most that could be done, was to draw the Arms, and
Copy out the Stiles, engraven on the Plates then remaining;
from whence the following Observations may be
made.</p>

<p class='c000'>First, That for many Years after the Institution of the
<i>Order</i>, the Plate whereon the Shield was engraved, bore
no other Inscription, than the deceased Knight’s Name, set
at the Foot thereof, under the Escutcheon of his Arms.
Afterwards, the chief Title of Honour began to be added,
though now and then, in the first and elder times,
both were omitted, as also their Crests. But about the
beginning of King <i>Henry</i> VIII’s Reign, not only the
Knight’s chief Title, but all other his Titles and Dignities,
whether Honorary, or Officiary, were drawn together
in one Inscription, concluding with that of Knight of this
most Noble <i>Order</i>; and which, about the same time, the
<i>Knights-Companions</i> used to insert, in all their publick
and private Instruments of Writing; a Custom observed
by the Knights of other Sovereigns <i>Orders</i> Abroad.</p>

<p class='c000'>At first the <i>Knights-Companions</i> gave their Paternal
Coats of Arms, singly and without any Quarterings;
but toward the beginning of <i>Hen.</i> V. they began to add
their Quarterings, as appears from the Escutcheons of
<i>Hugh</i>, Lord <i>Burnel</i>, who died 9 <i>Hen.</i> V. Sir <i>Lewis Robessart</i>,
and others. Yet was not the same generally
used, but left to the Pleasure of the <i>Knights-Companions</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>But of later times, this very thing was thought of such
concern, that where a Knight has been elected, who
wanted Quarterings, the Sovereign has been pleased to
grant him another Coat of Arms, to quarter with his
Paternal Coat; that his Banner, which ought to hang
over his Stall, might not seem too naked.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon after King <i>Henry</i> VIII’s Accession, the Knights
compassed their Shields with the Royal <i>Garter</i>, and thereon
(such as were Noblemen) placed the Coronet belonging
to their Dignity. As to Supporters, we observe two
<span class='pageno' title='495' id='Page_495'></span>Places to which they are added; the one of <i>John Beaufort</i>,
the first Duke of <i>Somerset</i> of that Name, elected 20
<i>Hen.</i> VI. the other of <i>Anthony Widvile</i>, Earl <i>Rivers</i>, elected
5 <i>Edw.</i> IV. and besides these, till the Reign of King
<i>Henry</i> VIII. there is not another Example: But then it
grew into common usage, as also the ingraving their peculiar
Motto’s, or Devices upon the Plates.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>The Offering of Atchievements.</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>§ 3. A third Honour paid to the defunct Knight, is
a most solemn Offering up his Atchievements at the High
<i>Altar</i>; namely, the Banner of his Arms, his Sword, Helmet,
and Crest, with its Mantlings; all which had been
set up over his Stall at his Installation. The Ceremony
of Offering these Ensigns does not appear to have been
regulated at the Institution of the <i>Order</i>, but rather added
as an additional Honour, by King <i>Henry</i> V. and the
manner thereof set down in the fourteenth Article of his
Body of <i>Statutes</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Solemnity is local to the Chappel of St. <i>George</i>,
within the Castle of <i>Windsor</i>, and not to be performed till
the Sovereign has notice of the <i>Knight-Companion’s</i> Death.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1 <i>Edw.</i> VI. at the Feast then held at <i>Windsor</i>, there
arose a Question, whether the Atchievements of King
<i>Henry</i> VIII. which yet hung over the Sovereign’s Stall,
should be taken down and offered at the Mass of <i>Requiem</i>
ensuing, or not? in regard his Banner, Sword, Helm,
and Crest, with Mantles, had been offered up before, at
his Interment within that Chappel. In conclusion of
which it was determined, <i>That the said Atchievements
shou’d not again be offered, but remain over the Sovereign’s
Stall, for his Son King</i> Edward VI. But when the Sovereigns
of this most Noble <i>Order</i> are not interred at
<i>Windsor</i>, then their Atchievements are offered up the next
ensuing Feast; as were those of Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>, which
the <i>Blue-Book</i> notes to be done at Morning Prayer.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the time for performing this Ceremony, it was
ordained to be on the Morrow after the Feast, when the
Mass was Sung for the Souls of the <i>Knights-Companions</i>,
<i>&amp;c.</i> and so was duly observed till the time of the Reformation,
when the Mass of <i>Requiem</i> being abolished, it was
nevertheless at the Morning Service, on the Morrow immediately
<span class='pageno' title='496' id='Page_496'></span>after the Offertory: But after Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>
had removed the Feast of St. <i>George</i> from <i>Windsor</i>, this
Solemnity was frequently dispatched in one Day, before
they went out of the <i>Choir</i>; and the ancient Rule, as to
the time, being thus broke, was never after restored, but
generally performed the very same Morning wherein the
elect Knights were installed: And though the Day was
thus changed, yet the Ceremony it self was not performed
till after the Installation was finished, that Solemnity having
always the Precedency, till 9 <i>Jac.</i> I. when he observing
how incongruous it seemed, to instal a new Knight before
his Predecessor had been fully discharged of his Stall,
gave Order for Offering the Atchievements of Sir <i>Henry
Lea</i>, the Lord <i>Scroop</i>, and others, before the Instalment
of the elect Knights.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not long after, it was thought convenient to perform
this Ceremony on the Eve of the Feast, presently after
the first <i>Vespers</i> began; and next to proceed with the Installations;
whereby, as much as possible, the Stalls of the
<i>Knights-Companions</i> might be supplied, in all the rest of
the Solemnities of the Feast. But if at any time, any of
the new elect Knights were introduced into the <i>Choir</i>,
before the Offering of the Atchievements began, they
were appointed to stand there under the Stalls designed for
them till that Ceremony was finished.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus it continued from the said 9 <i>Jac.</i> I. till the 15
<i>Car.</i> II. when it was performed at the time anciently accustomed
for it; the Prince of <i>Denmark</i>, and the Duke
of <i>Monmouth</i>, being both installed before the first <i>Vespers</i>
began, and the Atchievements of the defunct Knights not
offered till the Morrow after the Feast Day.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the Manner and Order of this Ceremony, among
other Institutions of King <i>Henry</i> V. it is appointed, <i>That
as often as, through the vacancy of any Stall, the Swords,
Helms, with the rest of the defunct Knights, ought to be
offered, the Sword of the deceased Knight shall be first offered,
being carried up to the</i> High Altar <i>by two of the</i> Knights-Companions,
<i>and afterwards the Helm, with the Crest and
Mantlings, by two other</i> Knights-Companions; <i>and this
Offering is to be made for them, in the Order they were
installed, not as they died</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>But of the Offering of a defunct Knight’s Banner, we
find no express mention till 18 <i>Hen.</i> VII. at which time
<span class='pageno' title='497' id='Page_497'></span>the Banner of the Lord <i>Brook</i> was offered: But afterwards
the direction for Offering their Ensign and Banner
was taken into King <i>Henry</i> VIII’s Body of <i>Statutes</i>. And
since the same were introduced, according to the foregoing
Precedent, it was to be offered first, and so hath
been generally observed.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the appointment of the <i>Statutes</i> of <i>Henry</i> V. the Sovereign
is to nominate and assign the <i>Knights-Companions</i>,
who are severally to perform this Ceremony; and so is the
direction in <i>Henry</i> VIII’s <i>Statutes</i>: But since the beginning
of Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>’s Reign, the Knights have generally
proceeded to this Offering, according to their Seniority;
and when the Course ended, then the <i>Seniors</i>
began again. There are likewise many Examples where the
Sovereign’s Lieutenant has joined in the Ceremony to assist
the other Knights: Nor is a Proxy, or Deputy, to be
admitted to perform any part of the Ceremony, though in
the Offering of Money he ought.</p>

<p class='c000'>We shall next proceed to the Duties of the Prelate of
the <i>Order</i>, the Prebends, and Officers of Arms, as their
Services severally, or jointly, relate to the performance of
this Ceremony. First then, the Prelate, and two Prebends,
ought to proceed up to the <i>Altar</i>, immediately before
<i>Garter</i> summons down the <i>Knights-Companions</i> to
the Offering; and there stand ready to receive the Atchievements,
as they are severally offered up.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is next the Duty of the <i>Provincial Kings</i>, and <i>Heralds</i>,
to conduct the <i>Knights-Companions</i>, when they proceed up
to the <i>Altar</i>, bearing any part of the defunct Knight’s Atchievements.
The whole Ceremony is briefly thus.</p>

<p class='c000'>First <i>Garter</i> rises from his Seat, and proceeds into the
middle of the <i>Choir</i>, where, after his usual Obeysances, he
summons the <i>Knights-Companions</i> to descend, who come
down and place themselves before their Stalls: Whereupon
<i>Clarenceux</i> and <i>Norroy</i> (or in the absence of either,
the <i>Senior Herald</i>, or of both, of the two eldest <i>Heralds</i>,)
pass down from the Steps of the <i>Altar</i> into the Body of
the <i>Choir</i>; in the interim <i>Garter</i> takes the <i>Banner</i> of the
eldest defunct Knight, and presents it, half rolled up, to
the two <i>Senior Knights-Companions</i>; the two <i>Provincial
Kings</i> by this time approaching them, make their double
Reverences, and after to the other <i>Knights-Companions</i>,
and then stand a little aside; while the two <i>Senior</i> Knights,
<span class='pageno' title='498' id='Page_498'></span>having taken the <i>Banner</i> between them, make their double
Reverence, and pass up to the <i>Altar</i>, (preceeded by the
Kings) bearing it with the lower end of the Staff foremost,
and at the first <i>Haut-Pas</i> make another double Reverence.
The <i>Provincial Kings</i> being arrived at the uppermost <i>Haut-Pas</i>,
after an humble Obeysance, divide themselves to
make way for the Knights to Offer, who forthwith raise
the Point of the <i>Banner</i> upwards, and after a single Reverence
toward the <i>Altar</i>, present it upon their Knees, to
the Prelate of the <i>Order</i>, who delivers it to two Canons,
and they deposite it upon Cushions laid before the <i>Altar</i>.
This done, the two <i>Provincial Kings</i> conduct the Knights
back into the <i>Choir</i>, who, with the usual Reverences, retire
to their Stations, under (not to) their Stalls, and the
<i>Provincial Kings</i> to their, on either side the <i>Altar</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next the two <i>Senior Heralds</i> pass down into the <i>Choir</i>,
as the <i>Provincial Kings</i> did, whilst <i>Garter</i>, taking up the
Sword, presents it to the two next <i>Senior</i> Knights, who
proceed to the <i>Altar</i> with the two <i>Heralds</i> before them,
in the same Order as before, bearing the Sword between
them, and offer the same with the Pommel or Hilt upwards,
and then retire as before.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the next place, the two next <i>Senior Heralds</i> go down
as before, and the <i>Helm</i> and <i>Crest</i> is offered in the like
manner: But the <i>Pursuivants</i> at <i>Arms</i> do no part of this
Duty.</p>

<p class='c000'>Heretofore we find that <i>Garter</i> has not only begun this
Solemnity, by presenting the <i>Banner</i>, but has also conducted
the two <i>Senior</i> Knights to the <i>Altar</i>, as he did 5
<i>Eliz.</i> by the <i>Banner</i> of the Lord <i>Grey</i>; and at some other
times. It was likewise the usage heretofore for the Prelate
to deliver the offered Atchievements, to some of the
<i>Heralds</i>, to be deposited near the <i>Altar</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is nothing on this farther observable, than what
relates to the Atchievement it self, which, as they became
by this Ceremony part of the Goods of the Chappel, and
included within the Words of the <i>Statutes</i> of the College,
whereby the Sovereign granted to the Dean and Canons
all Oblations, they could not be sold or alienated, and
were therefore deposited by them in the <i>Chapter-House</i>: But
the <i>Helms</i> and <i>Swords</i>, because they were at first forged
for the Service of War, of an extraordinary large size,
have been frequently redeemed, that they might serve
<span class='pageno' title='499' id='Page_499'></span>again to the same uses. And likewise, because it belongs
to <i>Garter</i> to provide Atchievements for new installed
Knights, he usually hath compounded with the Dean and
Canons for the defunct Knight’s Atchievements.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><i>Of depositing the deceased Knights</i> Mantles <i>in the</i> Chapter-House.</h3>

<p class='c011'>$ 4. In 9 <i>Eliz.</i> there passed a Decree, <i>That the</i> Knights-Companions
<i>should be bound by their Oaths, to take care, by
their last Will, that after their Decease, all their Ornaments,
which they had receiv’d, should be restored, the Robes
to the College, and the Jewels to the King that gave them</i>.
Sir <i>Christopher Hatton</i> complied with the Decree, and sent
his <i>Mantle</i> accordingly; but that of Sir <i>Henry Lea</i>, being
left to the disposal of others, and not sent to the College,
happened at length to come into the Hands of Brokers, and
was openly exposed to Sale in <i>Long-lane</i>, to the great
dishonour of the <i>Order</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Decree was in after times but slackly observed,
and therefore in a <i>Chapter</i> held at <i>Windsor</i>, 4 <i>Car.</i> I. the
Knights were admonished, <i>That when the Sovereign should
vouchsafe to bestow the</i> Mantle <i>of the</i> Order, <i>the Knight
should take care at his Death, to have it sent to the Chappel
at</i> Windsor, according to the <i>Statutes</i>. But this taking
little Effect, the Sovereign thought fit to restore vigorously
the Law in this particular, by a Decree in <i>Chapter</i>, 13
<i>Car.</i> I. which obliged all <i>Knights-Companions</i>, receiving
the Ensigns of the <i>Order</i> from the Sovereign, to take
care, according to the tenor of their Oaths, that these,
together with the Book of <i>Statutes</i>, should be restored
in the Hands of the Sovereign, after their Deaths; and
a Command was therewithal given, <i>That certain</i> Books,
Mantles, <i>and</i> Surcoats, <i>then lying at</i> White-Hall, <i>shou’d
be delivered to the</i> Register <i>of the</i> Order, <i>to be laid up at</i>
Windsor, <i>in honourable Memory of those to whom they belonged</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Observation of these Decrees, where the <i>Habit</i> and
<i>Ensigns</i> of the <i>Order</i> were either wholly, or in part, bestowed
by the Sovereign, Order was taken, at the Decease
of such <i>Knights-Companions</i>, to send for them in
again. As at a <i>Chapter</i> held 15 <i>Car.</i> I. the <i>Garter</i> and
<span class='pageno' title='500' id='Page_500'></span><i>George</i> of the Lord Treasurer <i>Weston</i> being sent back,
were presented to the Sovereign; and after delivered to
the <i>Dean</i> and <i>Chapter</i> of <i>Windsor</i>, to be preserved: And
in the same <i>Chapter</i> it was ordered, that the Earl of <i>Kelly</i>’s
Robes and Ornaments of the <i>Order</i>, should be sent for by
the Chancellor.</p>

<p class='c000'>These former Decrees were yet thought needful to be
confirm’d by King <i>Charles</i> II. so that in a <i>Chapter</i> held
1669. at <i>White-Hall</i>, it was Decreed, <i>That the Mantle
of each</i> Knight-Companion, <i>with the Book of</i> Statutes, should
be sent to <i>Windsor</i>, immediately after their Deaths; <i>and
that the Chancellor of the</i> Order <i>should be obliged, by Letters
to their Heirs and Executors, to put them in mind of
sending them thither</i>. But it is to be understood, that
where the Mantle has been provided at the Knight’s own
Charge, there is no obligation for returning them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus I have run through all the Particulars, relating to
the Institutions, Laws, and Ceremonies, of this most Noble
<i>Order</i>; I shall in the last Place proceed to give a List
of all those who have enjoyed this singular Mark of Honour
from its first Foundation. The Motives which excited
the Royal Founder to set on Foot the said <i>Order</i>,
are already particularly treated of; who having established
<i>Rules</i> and <i>Statutes</i> for the Government, and regulation
thereof, he next resolved to elect, from among the
Flower of his own Wars, twenty five of the most celebrated
Knights, who, together with himself, should make
up the Number of Twenty six; for of so many does the
<i>Order</i> by his Appointment consist: And indeed that Age
plentifully furnished him with Men of the most brave and
celebrated Characters, and of signal Reputation in Arms,
raised by the eminent Wars of those times, and justly
distinguished by their own heroick Actions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first that he elected into this Noble <i>Order</i>, was
<i>Edward</i>, his eldest Son, who already in part deserved,
and afterwards justly obtained the Title of a Brave and
Martial Prince, of whom our Histories speak so largely.
The rest of his accomplished Collegues, were these that
follow, and are thus placed in their Stalls.</p>
